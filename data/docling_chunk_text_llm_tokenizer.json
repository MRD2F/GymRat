This is his true superpower. He is a movement genius but trained as an expert in understanding the all-too-common problems of injury, pathology, and human durability.

Let us know what you nd."}, "14": {"text": "Behind many a legendary tale, there is a hidden lesson to be learned. Those who incorporate weight training with the goal of improving their physique, strength, or power should look to the story of Milo of Croton.\nMilo was an ancient Greek Olympian and the poster child for athletic excellence in his time. Legend has it that at a young age, Milo started his strength journey by lifting a small calf and carrying it on his shoulders every day. As the calf grew over the years, so did Milo's strength, until one day he was hoisting a full-grown bull! Although it is unlikely that he was able to lift a 1,500-pound bull, like any good story, the legend sprang from humble beginnings."}, "15": {"text": "The 2,500-year-old story of how Milo built his heroic strength set forth the training principle that all athletes adhere to. That principle is now known as 'progressive overload.' Within Milo's story is the idea that hard work combined with consistency can lead to legendary feats of strength and awe-inspiring athletic performance.\nDeep inside each and every one of us is an innate desire to become our own version of Milo. The idea of building incredible strength and meeting our physical goals is why so many of us push our bodies day in and day out. While at surface level the story of Milo may seem simple, the reality is that the process of building extraordinary strength is as much about grit, hard work, and determination as it is about science."}, "16": {"text": "You see, our bodies adhere to a scientic 'code,' a simple framework of rules governed by the laws of biology and physiology. The code is simple. To develop strength, you must strike a balance between stress and recovery. Every time you perform a set of squats, pick up a heavy deadlift, or press a barbell overhead, you place a stress on your body. The harder your training session, the more stress you accumulate. To progressively develop more and more strength, the demands of your training must not exceed the adaptive capabilities of your body. Therefore, training must be balanced with recovery for the body to adapt, rebuild itself, and gain strength. If you follow this code, the sky is the limit for athletic performance.\nSounds simple enough, right? Not so fast."}, "17": {"text": "In our pursuit of amassing strength, we all push the envelope. Our inner competitor drives us to complete one more rep, put 10 more pounds on the bar, and take one more attempt at setting a personal record on a lift. This kind of determination is vital if you want to excel as a strength athlete. However, it can just as quickly become a double-edged sword.\nWhen we push our bodies to their physical limits and ignore the code, they eventually push back. I have never met a strength athlete who didn't have a nagging injury at some point in their career. Sometimes these injuries interfere with their training. When we push our bodies to the max and don't focus on sufficient recovery and/or lack ideal technique, injuries will occur. As fate would have it, in our quest to become our own version of Milo, we wind up falling short of our destination.\nI want to share two stories with you."}, "18": {"text": "Josiah O'Brien was like many powerlifters. He was a hard worker who was loyal to his friends and family, and he loved lifting heavy weight in the gym with death metal blasting. He never used a foam roller and thought mobility work was a waste of time. When parts of his body started to hurt, he ignored the pain. He lived by the mantra 'no pain, no gain.' Unfortunately, this lifestyle eventually caught up with him.\nOn October 22, 2016, Josiah entered a competition at 22nd Street Barbell in Des Moines, Iowa. The meet started like any other. After successfully completing his second of 3 squat attempts at 638 pounds, he decided to go for 655, a feat only 5 pounds heavier than his personal best at the time."}, "19": {"text": "After unracking the massive weight, he took a few steps back and set his feet. To his surprise, the bar felt 'light' on his back. However, as he descended into the squat, disaster struck. He heard and felt both legs snap. The weight came crashing down, pinning his legs behind his body as he crumpled to the oor.\nThat day, Josiah ended up tearing almost every supporting ligament and tendon (quad and patellar) in both knees. He was rushed to the nearest hospital in the bed of his friend's truck, unable to sit in the back seat, as the massive amount of swelling and pain wouldn't allow him to bend his knees. This was only the start of his troubles. Josiah ended up developing rhabdomyolysis, a serious condition in which the kidneys start to fail because the muscle damage to the body is so severe."}, "20": {"text": "In the following weeks after Josiah was stabilized, he underwent extensive surgery to repair the torn ligaments and tendons. He then was placed in straight leg braces (unable to move his knees whatsoever) for 12 weeks. Eventually, in early 2017, he came to me to start physical therapy.\nIt would be an understatement for me to say that this was the most challenging case I had ever seen. By this time in my career, I had helped\nhundreds of athletes rehab knee injuries ranging from meniscus repairs to ACL reconstructions. The damage inicted on Josiah's body that day in\nOctober 2016 was on a whole different level. After all was said and done, rebuilding his body required over 100 physical therapy visits spread out\nover nine months. He had to completely relearn how to walk, jump, and run.\nHe hobbled into my clinic that rst day, unable to walk normally, and left with the ability to deadlift over 600 pounds, jump over 24-inch"}, "21": {"text": "hurdles, and run without any issues. He even returned to the competition platform on August 12, 2017, less than a year after the devastating injury,\nand successfully squatted 195 pounds. While the weight on the bar was a far cry from the 600-plus pounds he was used to moving, he proved to\nhimself that this injury hadn't redened who he was. He was a powerlifter, and powerlifters never quit.\nThe second story is my own. As an aspiring weightlifter, I always dreamed of the day I could compete on the same stage with the best in the United States. While my ambition far outweighed my athletic talent and strength, I was able to qualify for the 2011 USA Weightlifting Senior National Championships in the 85-kilo (187-pound) weight class."}, "22": {"text": "Leading up to the competition, I decided to turn up the heat in my preparation. I started to pull two-a-day training sessions. I would wake up at 6 a.m. to get my squats and pulls in before heading to grad school classes for the day. I would return later to nish up whatever snatches, cleans, or jerks the program had in store. There was no way I was going to pass up my chance to perform at my very best on the national stage.\nA few weeks before the competition, I developed severe pain in my left knee. Every time I went into a deep squat, it felt like a knife was being jabbed into my patellar tendon. So I did what every physical therapy student would do: I went to my professors for guidance. The advice I received was the same unfortunate advice that many athletes in my situation are given: 'Just stop lifting so often.'\nSeriously? They knew I had a huge competition coming up soon. I couldn't just stop lifting."}, "23": {"text": "So I resorted to doing what most athletes do in this situation. Before each training session, I would pop three or four Advil and slather Icy Hot all over my knee, and I iced my knee at the end of each day. While I was able to make it through the rest of my training cycle without further injury, I was frustrated by how the competition went. I placed sixth in my weight class, but I knew I could have performed better if my training hadn't been interrupted by this injury."}, "24": {"text": "I tell you these stories to remind you that all strength athletes deal with pain. While Josiah's life-threatening injury is the exception rather than the rule, the underlying theme of both stories remains true. When you train hard and don't give your body enough time to recover, the stresses of training begin to accumulate. And when you mix in less-thanperfect lifting technique, they add up even faster. Eventually, these stresses culminate in injury. Ninety-nine percent of the time, the pain you experience as a strength athlete is not a severe medical emergency like Josiah's, but minor aches and pains like mine that disrupt your training and limit your performance."}, "25": {"text": "Unfortunately, most athletes don't have the basic knowledge of how to perform simple maintenance on their own bodies. From an early age, athletes are told that pain is a normal part of training. This mindset has created a cycle where athletes continue to lift and push through pain until they literally break. It is not until the pain affects performance that athletes nally seek help. We must put a stop to this broken system of lift, lift, break . While it is impossible to eliminate all aches and pains from weight training, we can have better control over it.\nToday's society tells us that pain is a medical problem. I don't believe this is correct. You see, the way in which many in the medical community address pain is to treat the symptoms of pain and not the cause . While the 'solution' of painkillers and anti-inammatories might satisfy your craving for a quick x, it is not going to help you in the long run. On the other hand, restoring optimal movement through subtle improvements in strength, mobility, and coordination is the key to solving pain and returning to a high level of performance."}, "26": {"text": "Using temporary quick xes to address pain is like putting a piece of tape over a hole in your car's tire. This isn't to say that these xes have no value. Sometimes you need that piece of tape to get your car to the mechanic. But covering it up doesn't change the fact that there is a hole in your tire.\nIf you still have pain after you've completed this book, I recommend that you seek professional care. I encourage you to take this book with you to consultations so that you and the rehabilitation professional are on the same page about your recovery and your desire to x the cause of your pain rather than just cover it up.\nThere is always a reason for pain. It doesn't develop out of thin air. It not only hinders your performance but also changes the way you move. Pain affects your coordination and the efficiency of your technique. It limits your mobility and diminishes your strength-all of which are part of your body's effort to protect itself from further injury."}, "27": {"text": "If you've picked up this book, you know what I mean. You've likely already experienced a problem. Being unable to lift like you want without pain is frustrating and straight-up maddening. Trust me, I've been there. I get it.\nI'm here to tell you that there is hope. David Viscott once wrote, 'The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The work of life is to develop it. The meaning in life is to give your gift away.' I have made it my life's purpose to help every single person who walks into a weight room get back to doing what they love to do without pain . The information contained in this book is the culmination of my life's work as a performance physical therapist, and I want to share it with you."}, "28": {"text": "Now, the ideas presented in these pages may challenge some of your beliefs about how to address pain. I want to put you back in control of your body and what you're feeling. The majority of the aches and pains we experience are not serious medical issues. Fixing them doesn't require a visit to the doctor or an expensive surgery. As physical therapist Kelly Starrett says, 'You wouldn't bring your car to the mechanic to put air in your tires or call an electrician to change a light bulb.' Simply stated, you should have the ability to perform basic maintenance on your own body."}, "29": {"text": "Through these pages, you'll be guided along a path to uncover the why behind your injury.

You'll learn how to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses with simple-to-perform tests and assessments. Once you've uncovered the precise cause of your pain, you can immediately apply the suggested exercises and strategies in your training to help decrease your pain and build a strong foundation for enhancing your future performance."}, "30": {"text": "To maximize the effectiveness of this book, I recommend that you choose a chapter to start with and read that chapter in its entirety. Take mental notes the rst time through to understand the differences between the injuries. The text contains the most up-to-date science on injury and rehabilitation, but I explain it in a way that anyone can comprehend. The more you understand the why behind your symptoms, the more empowered you will feel to take control of your recovery and stay consistent with the recommended rehab plan.\nThe second time through the chapter, perform the diagnostic tests and suggested rehabilitative exercises. Go slowly through each movement and listen to your body. The journey to become pain-free will take discipline and commitment.\nIn 1997, Apple released the iPod.

Not only does an injury to your back instantaneously drain you of power and strength, but it can also have an intense psychological effect that leaves you feeling like a shell of yourself.\nIf you've ever had a back injury, ask yourself if this story sounds familiar.\nRyan is a 24-year-old CrossFitter. During a recent competition, he felt a small 'pop' in his low back while nishing up his round of 30 clean and jerks at 135 pounds. He struggled through the rest of the competition and has since been dealing with debilitating pain every time he bends over. Even little tasks such as picking up a sock off the oor and tying his shoes have become extremely difficult to perform."}, "35": {"text": "After two months of dealing with this aggravating pain and feeling frustrated that his training had started to stagnate and decline, Ryan decided to see someone about it. His doctor told him that he needed an MRI scan of his spine. So Ryan made another appointment and waited patiently, hoping that the end of his pain was in sight.\nUnfortunately, his journey was just beginning.\nAfter another two anxious weeks, the day of his next appointment nally came. Over six short minutes of face-to-face time, the doctor looked at the scans of Ryan's spine and gave him a diagnosis of a 'bulging disc.' He wrote up a prescription for heavy pain medication and told Ryan to stop weight training and take it easy for the next few weeks.\nAfter six weeks of rest, Ryan's pain had started to decrease, so he did what every athlete would do: he went back to the weight room. However, after only a week, the pain returned. Heartbroken, he went to see his doctor again, who gave him the fateful prognosis that surgery was likely the best option."}, "36": {"text": "Have you found yourself in a similar situation? If so, you're not alone. Year after year, millions of people around the world are stricken with back pain. Research has shown that up to 80 percent of adults will experience low back pain at some time in their lives.  1  An even more troubling statistic is that many of them will experience recurring episodes.  2\nLifts like the squat, deadlift, and Olympic lifts place tremendous forces on the low back.  3  It should not be surprising, then, that low back injuries are among the most prevalent injuries sustained by strength athletes,  4  as Ryan found out the hard way.\nUnfortunately, the way traditional medicine approaches back pain today leaves many athletes and patients addicted to painkillers. Worse, some undergo multiple back surgeries when their injuries could have been resolved with much more conservative measures. Finding the solution to a serious back injury can be tricky, but it is certainly possible without injections, addictive pain meds, or operations."}, "37": {"text": "Next, I am going to walk you through every step of Ryan's experience. I want to expose the holes in it and show you how our medical community largely treats low back pain the wrong way. Then I am going to show you how things should be done, with a step-by-step plan that you can use to empower yourself to understand and x your pain.\nLet's start with the rst problem in Ryan's story: the idea that a doctor can determine why a patient has back pain just by looking at an MRI."}, "38": {"text": "Have you heard the expression 'a picture is worth a thousand words'? It means that something can be summed up better with a single image than a lengthy description. This phrase shouldn't have any place in the diagnosis of back pain.\nAn MRI of the spine can ' t tell us everything we need to know.\nRyan's doctor gave him the diagnosis of 'back pain caused by a bulging disc' simply by looking at an expensive 'picture' of his spine. Many medical doctors seek out 'abnormal' ndings (like a bulging disc) on an MRI scan, interpret them to be recent developments, and presume these specic tissues to be the source of pain. Basically, if something looks off on the scan, it is assumed to be the exact cause of the newly developed pain.\nThis presumption that 'abnormalities' on imaging can be directly linked to the cause of pain is awed for many reasons, including these:"}, "39": {"text": "- Results on imaging show poor correlation to symptoms of pain.  5\n- The MRI scan cannot show if the damage is a new 'wound' or an old 'scar.'\n- Pathology does not necessarily drive treatment.\n- The MRI shows only anatomy, not function.\nWhat if I told you that disc bulges are fairly common and often show up on lumbar spine MRI scans? It's true! Many people are walking around with disc bulges but have zero back pain.\nResearch has estimated that almost a third of healthy, pain-free 20year-olds have a disc bulge in their spine.  6  This number increases by 10 percent for every decade of life, meaning that half of all 40-year-olds likely have a disc bulge yet are not experiencing back pain."}, "40": {"text": "In 2006, a group of researchers collected MRI scans of 200 individuals without any history of back pain.  7  Those who developed severe pain during the study had new MRIs taken, and their results were compared with the previous scans. You may be surprised to hear that in 84 percent of those who developed pain, there was zero difference in their spines from their original scans. Some people even had improved markers compared to their rst MRI! Clearly, research has shown that just because a scan picks up an 'abnormality' does not necessarily mean that it is the root cause of pain.  8\nWhen a radiologist sees a bulging disc on an MRI scan, they have no way to determine whether it is due to a recent event (a wound) or is 20 years old (a scar). This is because disc bulges can heal over time and no longer cause pain, even if they are still visible on an MRI."}, "41": {"text": "It's also important to understand that an injury to the spine is different from an injury to the knee or hip. A spine injury sets off a cascade of events.  9  For example, when the spine is compressed under load, a healthy disc helps distribute that load evenly across the entire vertebral bone. When a disc bulge occurs, the load is no longer evenly distributed but instead is shifted to the posterior aspects of the spine (the facet joints).\nJust like a at tire on a car, the injured disc loses stiffness and pressure, leaving the car to drive a little unevenly on the road."}, "42": {"text": "While the pain from a disc bulge may 'burn out' in a few weeks or months, the mechanics of the spine are instantly changed. How the spine carries load from then on is affected at that particular segment, and forces are shifted to the facet joints. Therefore, if someone with back pain receives an MRI, there is no way a radiologist can determine whether an observed disc bulge is a new 'wound' generating symptoms. It is very possible that the 'abnormality' is a 'scar' that is no longer creating pain, and the true source of pain is an issue at the facet joints. Proper rehab that instills sufficient core stability limits this cascade of events."}, "43": {"text": "Even if the anatomical structure causing pain is identied, this knowledge does little to guide the clinician in nding the best x for rehabilitation.  10  A problem like a disc bulge could be due to a number of causes. For this reason, doing a simple Google search for '5 best exercises for a disc bulge' would be of no benet. In the end, the only person who benets from this knowledge is the surgeon who attempts to 'x' the presumed cause of pain.\nMoreover, an MRI scan is a picture of your anatomy in only one particular posture. It would be na\u00efve to think that a mechanic could look at a picture of a race car and know exactly why it's making a weird noise when shifting from third to fourth gear above 60 mph. However, while you may be quick to question a mechanic who would attempt to diagnose your car troubles in this manner, we are hesitant to do the same with medical doctors attempting to interpret the results of an MRI."}, "44": {"text": "To make an accurate diagnosis of a car's issue, a skilled mechanic must take the car for a spin, rev the engine, and test the capabilities of the machine. Simply put, the mechanic must establish context for what is creating the problem. The same goes for the human body. We need context from a thorough examination to uncover which specic movements, loads, and postures trigger pain. Only after completing this process can we turn to imaging if we want to look deeper and know which specic tissues are likely driving symptoms."}, "45": {"text": "Here's an example of how you should view the results of an MRI. Going back to Ryan's story, let's say he has pain only when getting into the bottom of a deadlift. After further observation, it becomes apparent that his low back is fully exed/rounded in that position. Ryan also mentions that he has no pain when standing upright or walking. If having him perform that same deadlift while focusing on limiting excessive exion in his low back decreases his pain, we can come to the understanding that the movement of exion under load is the trigger of his pain.\nIf Ryan's MRI shows an active disc bulge, we can say with more condence that his painful low back exion coincides with that nding. When Ryan rounds his lumbar spine excessively, the forces are unevenly distributed, causing the inner nucleus to seep its way through the outer ring of the disc and triggering pain. Without the context found through the examination, however, there is no way to determine if the ndings from an MRI are truly the cause of pain."}, "46": {"text": "Ryan's story took a turn for the worse the moment he met with a doctor whose only form of evaluation was to ask him some questions and order an MRI. The evaluation process is the most crucial part in xing back pain because it establishes the foundation on which the entire treatment plan is based. Ryan's evaluation was built on the rocky assumption that a picture is worth a thousand words."}, "47": {"text": "One of my biggest pet peeves is when doctors and other practitioners neglect to take the time to educate patients about the basics of anatomy and why their injuries occurred (called the injury mechanism ). I want to briey go over the anatomy of the low back and cover some of the most common injuries that occur in this region."}, "48": {"text": "Your spine is not just a stack of bones. It's a slightly curved 'tower' of small bones called vertebrae , separated by discs. These discs provide cushioning for the vertebrae as they move, much like airbags. Each vertebra is connected to the others through small joints in the back called facets , which give the spine tremendous movement options. You can ex your spine as you bend over to tie your shoes, extend it to place a box on a high shelf, twist it to drive a golf ball down the fairway, or do any conceivable combination of those to perform the latest dance move.\nNEUTRAL SPINE"}, "49": {"text": "When you stand with good posture, your spine assumes its 'neutral' alignment. This is not a completely straight position; as shown on the previous page, it has three distinct curves in the cervical (upper), thoracic (mid), and lumbar (lower) regions. Contrary to popular belief, neutral doesn't describe a singular static position; it describes a small range of motion or zone around the neutral posture.  11  Within this zone, load placed on the body (such as when squatting a barbell) is equally distributed across the discs and vertebrae. However, if the spine is loaded outside of this neutral zone, the forces are unevenly distributed, and the risk of injury increases.  12  Let's discuss specically how this injury may be created."}, "50": {"text": "Since starting the Squat University podcast, I have had several opportunities to speak with one of the world's most renowned experts on back pain, Stuart McGill. I can say with condence that in my career as a physical therapist, few people have had a greater impact on how I approach treating low back injuries than Dr. McGill. He has dedicated his life's work to researching the spine and has written extensively about back injuries and core stability in books such as Ultimate Back Fitness and Performance 13  and Back Mechanic , as well as countless professional journal articles. I highly recommend checking out his website, www.backtpro.com.\nIn one of our conversations, Dr. McGill laid out a simple way of understanding how injuries occur at the spine.

However, imagine how your back would feel if you tried to swing a 10-pound golf club over and over again!\nAs soon as you add load to the equation, things change. Think of a powerlifter attempting to deadlift 600 pounds. Obviously, the load is very high, and therefore the force needed to complete the movement is signicantly higher than the force needed to swing a golf club. If the athlete locks their spine and doesn't move it as they lift the weight, the overall power generated at the spine remains relatively low."}, "53": {"text": "If you load your body and then move your back, the power generated at the spine increases, as you have high force and high velocity, raising your risk of injury.  14  Therefore, the idea is quite simple. If you want your spine to move, you want to move it under minimal load. This is how dancers, MMA ghters, and golfers can safely compete in their sports. Similarly, if you want to lift heavy weight (placing load on the spine), it is best not to move your spine and keep it within the neutral zone. Lock it in place and keep it stiff while you move at the hips.\nNow, many variables inuence the timeline of exactly when an injury may occur. Even though the prior equation is simple in theory, the reality of how injuries happen is more complex. There is no ' X number of movements' that one can safely perform under a certain load before a disc herniation develops. But the mechanism for injury remains the same.

However, you must understand that the mechanism that creates a disc bulge includes exion. If the force applied to the spine as it exes is low, power generation remains low, and so does injury risk. This is why the cat-camel exercise (moving the spine through a full range in and out of exion but under low load) is a great option for many people. It is not until we introduce force into the equation that things begin to change. Flexion by itself isn't the problem."}, "63": {"text": "This is one reason why performing high-repetition Olympic lifts to the point of fatigue can lead to injury. The snatch and clean and jerk are amazing lifts if you don't break form. Elite weightlifters spend years perfecting their technique, often with low-repetition sets (1 to 3 lifts in a single set). However, consider a CrossFitter who performs 30 repetitions of the snatch lift as fast as possible in a fatigued state. While the quality of the rst few reps may be high, fatigue can slowly deteriorate form. The back starts to round slightly in the deep reception of the lift, increasing stress on the disc and creating a pathway for a potential bulge. Every spine has a breaking point, and the quickest way to nd it is to load your spine with a ton of compression and perform rep after rep with poor technique."}, "64": {"text": "But what about elite powerlifters who deadlift with a rounded back? Because lifting the most weight is the goal for competitive powerlifters, it is common to see a small degree of back rounding during max-effort deadlifts.  19  This is more often seen in those who use a conventional-style pulling technique versus a sumo-style deadlift (this is because the wider stance used during the sumo-style deadlift allows the lifter to have a more upright trunk position comparatively).

To start, elite powerlifters who lift with this technique aren't usually allowing their back to move into more exion as the lift is pulled.

So it's a little bit of exion, and then they lock it in place. When you measure this, the motion is still around the hips. This is the second best in terms of spinal stress and resilience to injury. For some lifters, it creates a mechanical advantage.'  21\nElite deadlifter with rounded back.\nDon Reinhoudt, \u00a9Bruce Klemens.\nSo, by not allowing any back motion\nto occur, powerlifters can limit the extreme amount of concentrated stress that would be transferred to the"}, "67": {"text": "spine if it were to be moved into more and more exion.  22  The rationale is that starting with a slightly rounded spine decreases the amount of force the low back extensor muscles need to generate to perform the movement.

A shorter moment arm theoretically demands less from the body to lift the weight from the oor.\nThis same rationale is what allows a strongman to lift the giant Atlas Stone safely.

Astronauts who are weightless for long periods in space commonly nd that they have lost bone density when they return to Earth. If we deload the body, the bones respond negatively and lose strength."}, "70": {"text": "Lifting heavy weights, however, can cause your spine to adapt and the trabecular struts within your vertebrae to thicken over time.  26  This is why\nresearch has shown elite powerlifters (who experience spinal compressive forces of up to 16 times their body weight) to have some of the densest vertebral bones seen in humans.  27  However, we must not be quick to assume that all loading is good loading.\nThe cells of your bones respond to the stimulus of load by building more bone (a process called osteogenesis ).  28  However, this process does not follow the 'more is better' mantra. If you load your spine with heavy training over and over again, you will eventually reach a stage of diminishing returns where the response to lifting begins to stagnate.

In his book Gift of Injury , Stuart McGill writes that he has never seen an elite powerlifter who did not have evidence of a history of microfractures in their spine.  29\nThese fractures usually start at a layer of tissue that is part bone and cartilage and separates the vertebra from the underlying disc, called the end plate . The end plate has two jobs. First, it has to be strong to handle compressive forces placed on the spine and prevent the inner gel of the disc from bulging into the bone above. Second, it must be porous or soft enough to allow nutrients and blood to ow to and from the disc below.\nVERTEBRA END PLATE"}, "72": {"text": "When a lot of compression is applied to the spine, the end plate is stretched across the bone it covers, like someone spreading plastic wrap across a bowl.  30  Excessive compression can eventually overwhelm this plate and cause it (along with the underlying trabecular bone of the vertebra) to crack."}, "73": {"text": "If given time to adequately recover after being overloaded during a heavy training cycle, the body can adapt and replace a microfracture with\nstronger bone.

Some facet joints can help create and limit excessive rotation of the spine, while others are set up to do the same for backward and forward bending."}, "76": {"text": "For this reason, these joints can be injured during a number of different movements. For example, when the spine is extended to extreme end ranges (like an athlete who overarches their back while pressing a barbell over their head), a large amount of pressure shifts to these small joints of the lower spine (lumbar spine), which stretches the surrounding capsule.  36  If the body cycles too often into this position, it can irritate these joints and the surrounding capsules, leading to pain and eventual arthritis."}, "77": {"text": "Research has also shown that facet joint irritation can be caused by combining either exion or extension of the spine with rotation.  37  Let's take, for example, a weightlifter who has uneven hip mobility. If they move under the bar to catch a heavy clean, a mobility asymmetry in the hips could lead to a small twist in the pelvis, resulting in excessive stretch to the capsule of the lifter's lower spinal facet joints. If this side-to-side difference isn't addressed and xed, over time the small technique problem may lead to irritation of a facet capsule/joint and eventual pain.\nBARBELL CLEANWITH TWISTED HIPS"}, "78": {"text": "As discussed earlier, an injury to one part of the spine often sets off a cascade of events. If an athlete has a history of a disc bulge, load is no longer evenly distributed across the vertebrae. Instead, when the spine is loaded, forces at that particular vertebral joint shift to the posterior aspects of the spine (the facet joints). Over time, this overload of the facet joints could lead to arthritis and the development of pain. As you can see, the facet joints can be injured in many ways."}, "79": {"text": "Another possible injury to the structures on the back side of the spine is spondylolysis.

Eight of these athletes (31 percent) were found to have spondylolysis.  39  Another group of researchers studied 27 weightlifters and 20 powerlifters and found 21 (44 percent) to have spondylolysis.  40  No signicant difference was found between the weightlifters and powerlifters in this study."}, "82": {"text": "However, there are a few things to take into consideration when looking at these numbers. First, research has shown that spondylolysis is strongly inuenced by a person's genetics.  41  This means some of us are unfortunately predisposed to this injury, and the sport itself isn't necessarily the main culprit.\nSecond, every one of the studies that observed this injury among weightlifters did so before 1972. In that era, the clean and press was an official lift used in competition; it was removed in 1972. The pressing portion of this lift was usually performed with considerable extension of the lower back (out of the 'neutral zone').

This type of pain can be caused by a disc bulge, a narrowing of another canal of the spine, or an entrapment of the nerve by the piriformis muscle much lower at the hip. Pain that is felt traveling down the front of the thigh is caused by irritation of a different nerve, called the femoral nerve .

You should also have an understanding of which postures and movements you can perform pain-free. It is time to start addressing a common weak link in almost all cases of back pain: core instability.\nThink about the last time you went to your family doctor with a complaint of pain. There's a good chance the doc uttered these words: 'I recommend not lifting for a few weeks.' Sound familiar? Many people nd some short-term relief of their symptoms by following these orders. It makes sense on paper. If deadlifting causes your back to hurt, not deadlifting will likely decrease your pain! Problem solved, right? Wrong .\nChances are the pain will eventually return because you never addressed why the problem started in the rst place.\nEliminating the movement, posture, or load that causes your pain is only half the battle in xing any injury. Anyone can tell you to stop doing something that hurts. Eliminating symptoms and building your body to become more resilient to injury requires a different and more active approach."}, "151": {"text": "To kick-start this active approach, let's learn about the core and how it relates to both the cause and the x for low back injuries."}, "152": {"text": "Imagine a symphony orchestra. Just as every musician in an orchestra must play their instrument in a united manner despite constant changes in tempo and volume, your body must coordinate every muscle to create purposeful and sound movement.\nThe muscles that surround the spine-the front and side abdominal muscles, the erector muscles of the back, and even the larger muscles that span multiple joints, like the lats and psoas muscles-are considered the 'core' of the body. It may surprise you that the glutes are also an important part of the core (something you'll learn about very soon!).\nThese muscles must work together to enhance the stability of the spine."}, "153": {"text": "Spinal stability is something Dr. McGill has been able to dene and measure in his work. First, when muscles contract, they create force and stiffness. It is the stiffness that is important for stability. Think of the spine as a exible rod that needs to be stiffened to bear load. This is the role of the muscles. Through his research, he has measured athletes who failed to obtain appropriate muscular stiffness around the spine by coordinating muscle activation and their subsequent injuries and pain."}, "154": {"text": "Second, the body functions as a linked system, and distal movement requires proximal stability. Consider trying to move a nger back and forth very quickly-the wrist needs to be stable; otherwise, the entire hand would move. Now, using the same principle, consider the action of walking. The pelvis must be stable in relation to the spine; otherwise, the left hip would drop as the left leg swung forward to take a step. This core stiffness is non-negotiable to enable walking. Thus all body movement needs appropriate coordination of muscles. To move, run, or squat requires spinal stiffness and core stability.\nWhen the core fails to meet the stability demands placed on the body during certain lifts, parts of the spine are overloaded with forces that increase injury risk, and performance suffers-much like a bad musician who is playing off-pitch or off-beat, which would quickly affect the rest of the orchestra. Each muscle that surrounds or attaches to the spine must play in concert with others to produce safe, efficient and, when needed, powerful movement."}, "155": {"text": "There are two general approaches taken to address the core. The rst and more common method (which you'll see in tness clubs across the world) is dynamic strengthening exercises such as crunches, back extensions, and Russian twists. Traditionally, coaches and medical practitioners have used these exercises that build strength through movement with the mindset that a stronger core will give the spine less chance to buckle and break under tension.\nRUSSIAN TWIST WITH BALL\nTo a point, this is true. Each muscle that surrounds the spine does need a sufficient amount of strength to contract and 'turn on.' When the\nmuscles of the core contract, stiffness is created. Much like guy-wires that attach to and hold up a radio tower, each muscle that surrounds the spine\nmust provide a certain amount of tension and stiffness to maintain the strength of the spine as a whole and keep it from buckling and becoming\ninjured.\nRADIO TOWER WITH GUY-WIRES"}, "156": {"text": "However, here's what most people don't understand. Many people who develop back pain already have strong backs!  64  While exercises like Russian twists, sit-ups, and back extensions from a GHD machine may be great at increasing strength, they do little to increase core stiffness.  65\nTo enhance the quality of stiffness, you must train the core differently. This comes through the second approach of using isometric exercises built to enhance muscular endurance and coordination."}, "157": {"text": "An isometric describes when a muscle or group of muscles are activated and contracted, but there is no change in the joints they cross. For example, during a side plank, the lateral oblique and quadratus lumborum (QL) muscles are very active, yet the spine and hips remain still and do not move. Research has found that isometric exercises to enhance muscular endurance are far superior when compared to dynamic strengthening exercises in enhancing spinal stiffness and stability (making them ideal not only for rehabilitation of back injuries but also in the training and enhancement of athletic performance).  66\nQLIN SIDE PLANK"}, "158": {"text": "Have you ever pushed your body to the max while performing a highvolume squat session and ended up failing to complete the set? I have many times during my lifting career. You're tired, and while trying to grind out three more reps, you come up one short and have to drop the bar to the ground. Sound familiar? If this is something you've experienced, go back and review that specic set, but instead of analyzing the failed last rep, check out the one right before it. Often, the 'smoking gun' is a drop in core stability-you became a little loose in your ascent, your spine rounded ever so slightly, or your hips shifted a bit to the side."}, "159": {"text": "As soon as your brain senses a loss in core stability, it shuts down 'neural drive' to your muscles, making it much more difficult to squeeze out another rep. Without the core functioning correctly, your body has two choices. The rst is to allow technique to falter even more as you grind out the last rep (allowing for even more spinal rounding or hip shifting). While you may 'get the job done,' your risk for injury dramatically increases. The second option: fail the rep, drop the barbell to the ground, and live to squat another day.\nYou see, your brain shuts down how hard your body can push through that next repetition as a protective mechanism. The way to train your body to withstand this breakdown and maintain a high 'neural drive' to your muscles is to address the failure mechanism head-on (the why behind the collapse): core stability endurance."}, "160": {"text": "The denition of stability is the ability to limit excessive or unwanted motion. Therefore, the traditional way the tness and rehab world has approached addressing the core for years has been completely backward! This is why someone can have a ripped six-pack and yet easily experience technique breakdown when it comes to deadlifting or performing a squat.\nTo stiffen the torso and limit excessive motion, every muscle of the core must co-contract or work together. When this is done correctly through a bracing action, your body creates its natural 'weightlifting belt.' Not only will this stiffen your spine and keep it safe when performing heavy lifts (like a squat or deadlift), but it will also help transfer force throughout your body. For example, a weightlifter performing a jerk requires sufficient core stability to transfer the power he or she generates from their legs through the core and into the upward drive of the barbell."}, "161": {"text": "Much like the symphony orchestra analogy from before, every muscle of the core has a role to play, but none is more important than the others.

This method is awed for a number of reasons.\nFirst, research has shown that it is impossible for an individual to activate only one specic muscle of the core. Despite what your physical therapist or doctor says, you cannot train your multidus, your QL, or even your TA muscle in isolation."}, "162": {"text": "Even if it were possible to target a specic muscle of the core (as some would argue is possible through exercises like abdominal hollowing),\nmethods like this have been shown to be far less efficient in creating stability for the spine compared to abdominal bracing (contracting all of\nthe core muscles together).  67"}, "163": {"text": "Now that you know which types of exercises are superior for rehabbing most back injuries, it's time to discuss which exact exercises to start with. There is unfortunately no one-size-ts-all approach when it comes to core exercises because there is no one universal movement that equally stresses all of the muscles that surround the spine. For this reason, we must utilize a battery of exercises to work all of them efficiently.\nTechnically, any exercise can be a 'core' exercise if it is performed with sufficient attention to creating and maintaining a stable spine. It all depends on the objectives of the exercise and the individual's needs. One key to xing injured backs is to use exercises that enhance stability but place minimal stress on the spine while the exercises are being performed.\nIn his years of studying the spine, Dr. McGill has found three exercises that efficiently address all of these areas without placing excessive stress on the parts of the back that may be aggravated or irritated due to injury.

The most obvious effect is improved\nexibility (meaning you have more range of motion and can lift your leg higher during the next stretch); however, this effect doesn't always last\nlong.\nFor example, one study showed that the improved hamstring exibility seen after 5 rounds of a stretching protocol lasted only 6"}, "239": {"text": "minutes!  104  Thirty-two minutes after the stretching stopped, the muscles had returned to their prestretch length. Other, more extensive stretching protocols have shown that the effects of stretching can last anywhere from 60 to 90 minutes.  105  This means both the amount of time spent stretching and the length a stretch is held affect how long the short-term benets of improved exibility last. Regardless, the improved range of motion often returns to baseline.\nTheoretically, there are two ways to improve exibility. The rst model is the mechanical theory, which is based on the idea that if range of motion improves after stretching, that improvement can be due to either increased muscular length or decreased muscular stiffness.\nMuscles are fairly elastic, meaning that they can stretch when a force is applied to them and then return to their normal length after the force is removed, similar to a rubber band. We can measure elasticity two ways:"}, "240": {"text": "- Extensibility is the ability of a muscle to elongate or lengthen. It is usually dened as the ability to extend the muscle to a certain end point (most often the point at which a person feels they can't tolerate any more stretch without pain). We can measure extensibility by looking at the angle at which a joint can be moved, as with the hip joint during the SLR test.\n- Stiffness is how much force is needed during a stretch to elongate the muscles. It can be a tricky concept to dene (and isn't at all how most people use the word today) because stiffness can change based on how fast a stretch is applied and the angle of the joint.\nMost medical books that discuss stretching would have you believe that increases in exibility are often due to the mechanical model, and the muscle itself is actually lengthening when stretched. There are three theories under this model that try to justify the changes in exibility:"}, "241": {"text": "- Viscoelastic deformation: This is a fancy way of saying that muscles have both an elastic component (like a rubber band) and a viscous or gooey component (similar to honey). The idea is that as a stretch is applied, the force causes the muscle to relax, and exibility improves. However, research has been quick to disprove this theory, as any changes seen because of viscoelastic deformation are likely short-lived. For example, one research study showed that a hamstring stretch held for 45 seconds had no signicant effect on the next stretch performed 30 seconds later.\n- 106  If the muscle really deformed and stayed that way, the researchers would have seen a signicant difference.\n- Plastic deformation: Another popular theory states that the increased exibility observed after a stretch exists because the connective tissues that make up the muscle are stretched to a point where they become permanently lengthened. Research to support this notion, however, has been poor.  107"}, "242": {"text": "- Increased sarcomeres in series: The third theory is based on the idea that the building blocks that make up muscle (called sarcomeres ) increase in number in response to a stretch. Think of a sarcomere like a LEGO brick. A muscle is made up of thousands of muscle bers, each of which is composed of a long block chain of sarcomeres. Based on a few animal studies, researchers found that if they created a long held stretch (by splinting or immobilizing a joint in a cast for a few weeks and holding the muscle in a lengthened position), the body would increase the number of sarcomeres (more LEGO bricks in a row) by upwards of 20 percent. 108"}, "243": {"text": "Basically, the block chain inside each muscle ber is stretched to such a degree that the body decides to add more blocks to the chain to restore the prior 'normal' balance. However, what most people don't understand about this adaptive change is that it appears without an overall change in muscle length! While there may be more blocks in the chain of sarcomeres, the length of each block becomes smaller. The blocks basically shrink! Also, these adaptive changes do not last long; the muscle returns to its prior 'normal' number of sarcomeres within a few weeks.  109  So, while these few animal studies have shown there to be changes in the muscle architecture after four weeks of an immobilization stretch, it is a bit far-fetched to think that these same changes would be\nseen after an intermittent stretching program like the ones used by most athletes."}, "244": {"text": "The second and more probable theory for how stretching improves exibility is a change in sensation. The latest research has shown that much of the short-term increase in exibility comes from improving your stretch tolerance (or pain tolerance), not from increasing your muscles' length!  110  Basically, after stretching your hamstrings for a few sets of 30 seconds, you have more exibility because of your ability to tolerate a greater amount of stretch before you tap out."}, "245": {"text": "Unfortunately, almost all of the studies published on the effects of stretching have lasted only between three and eight weeks. The improvements seen in these short-term programs are a result of increased tolerance to muscle stretching. The research shows that there is no actual lengthening of the muscle bers.  111\nFor now, we are unsure of the long-term effects of stretching. It is entirely possible that individuals who partake in a rigorous stretching program for years actually can alter the extensibility of their muscles. In a few years, researchers may provide a concrete answer on the effects of long-term stretching (programs lasting several months to years)."}, "246": {"text": "If you want to see signicant changes in exibility of any muscle or group of muscles, you must be consistent with your stretching. It's easy to become frustrated with your lack of progress if you stretch only once every few days. As I mentioned before, the improved range of motion seen directly after a single stretching session often returns to baseline within minutes to hours. To nd your potential for signicant change, take 5 to 10 minutes every day to address your limitations."}, "247": {"text": "Let's switch gears and talk about why so many athletes are quick to stretch their hamstrings, especially those who have back pain. Here is a normal thought process that goes through the minds of many in the medical community when assessing someone who is experiencing back pain:\nWhen assessing the patient ' s straight-leg raise, they were unable to raise either leg past 70 degrees. We were taught in school that this means the person has  ' tight ' or short hamstrings. Short hamstrings have been shown in research to be associated with low back pain. This means we need to stretch the hamstrings as a part of the rehabilitation plan to decrease the back pain."}, "248": {"text": "In 2000, a group of researchers from the Netherlands conducted a study in which they looked at a number of factors among three groups: those with exible hamstrings, those with 'tight' hamstrings, and those with low back pain.  112  Here's what they found:"}, "249": {"text": "- Those with low back pain had the lowest hip range of motion via the SLR test (even worse than those with just 'tight' hamstrings). The researchers concluded that this decreased range of motion was due only to the hamstrings and did not have to do with any pelvic tilting or back mobility issues.\n- The hamstrings in both the exible group and the 'tight' group showed a similar 'defense reaction' as they were stretched. The farther the legs were stretched, the more electrical activity rose in all of the hamstring muscles. However, those with low back pain had an abnormal 'defense reaction' and did not have simultaneous electrical activity in all of their hamstrings. Also, the electrical activity they did record did not increase at the same gradual pace as it did in those who were pain-free. This difference was attributed to a heightened arousal or sensitivity to movement that occurs in those with back pain.\n- There was no difference in muscle stiffness between those with 'tight' hamstrings and those in the low back pain group."}, "250": {"text": "- Hamstring exibility in those with low back pain was worse than in those with 'tight' hamstrings, but this limited motion was not accompanied by an increase in muscular stiffness.\nHere's what this means: low back pain coupled with limited hamstring exibility is usually due to the nervous system going haywire. The hamstring muscles are reacting and behaving differently, which can affect a person's ability to tolerate a stretch."}, "251": {"text": "Armed with the information that limited hamstring exibility is due to a neuromuscular issue in individuals dealing with back pain, the solution is not passive stretching. So what should you do instead?\nThe three-step process for xing back pain is as follows:\n1. Wind down pain sensitivity by avoiding the motions, postures, and loads that trigger your pain. This will be different for each person and requires efficient screening.\n2. Improve core stability and mobility of the joint complexes above and below the site of pain.\n3. Improve movement quality: learn to move about the hips instead of the low back and reactivate the glutes.  113"}, "252": {"text": "Since we know that the hamstrings are not a cause of low back pain, we need to change our approach to how and when to improve hamstring exibility . We must rst discuss the difference between exibility and mobility. We can test the exibility or length of the hamstrings by performing the SLR test discussed on here and here. Mobility is different; it has a movement component and describes the body's ability to use its exibility, muscle tension/quality, and nervous system (aka motor control) to coordinate itself through a range.\nMobility should always be evaluated before exibility. Let's take the example of Jim, a national-level Olympic weightlifter. Jim has great hip mobility and coordination of his core stability and posterior chain muscles. He shows great-looking technique during his barbell lifts of the clean and snatch. If you ask him to bend over and touch his toes, he will perform what looks like a barbell RDL without any weight in his hands because his body has been programmed to move correctly about the hips over and over again in the gym."}, "253": {"text": "However, if you took Jim without looking at the quality of his movement and had him perform the SLR test, you might nd that he has relatively 'tight' hamstrings, as he is unable to lift his free leg straight past 80 degrees. Does this mean he should automatically be prescribed hamstring stretches?\nWhat if I told you that the relatively 'stiff' hamstrings of some athletes are an advantage and not a problem that needs to be stretched away?\nThink of your muscles as springs. When they are loaded with tension, they have the ability to explode with power and propel your body down a track."}, "254": {"text": "Now, 20-plus years ago, long-duration stretching was all the rage because researchers believed that static stretches before a workout or an athletic completion could help reduce the risk of a muscular strain injury. 114  So, if Jim had gone to a physical therapist back then, he would have been prescribed some long-duration (1 minute-plus) static stretching for his hamstrings by lying on his back and pulling his foot to the sky.\nNowadays the tides are turning. A growing amount of new research is showing that this type of stretching before exercise can lead to decreases in strength, power, and speed, thereby limiting an athlete's performance. 115  This is part of the reason why both the American College of Sports Medicine and the European College of Sports Sciences have come out condemning long-duration static stretching as part of a warm-up routine! 116"}, "255": {"text": "Now, does this mean we should never stretch? Not at all. Some athletes would benet from a certain amount of stretching to improve their exibility, get into better technical positions, and move more efficiently during training and competition. If you want to stretch before a training session or competition, I recommend short-duration stretches (less than 30 seconds), which have been shown to have no harmful effects on muscular performance.  117  It's not until the stretch is held for more than 45 seconds that we see losses in strength, power, and speed. In fact, research has shown that the ability of a muscle to produce force when subjected to these long-duration stretches (which are still prescribed by many tness trainers and coaches) is decreased for up to 30 minutes.  118"}, "256": {"text": "Will there be athletes who need long-duration stretches? Sure. I wouldn't discontinue them completely, but their use must be individualized to the athlete who needs to improve exibility in order to improve movement quality. If you are assigning a stretch just for the sake of stretching, you have already failed your client. I also recommend that, if you want to implement stretching into your own routine, you do it after a workout or on separate days/times from your training sessions.\nOn another note, if you have been stretching before your lifts for a long time and you have not seen any drops in performance, by all means continue with your routine. For instance, many gymnasts perform longduration stretches before their sessions yet are capable of producing adequate power. I would not change that warm-up routine because stretching is deeply ingrained in the sport."}, "257": {"text": "What may surprise you is that there is a way to improve exibility without any stretching at all! Yes, you read that correctly. Research has shown that muscle stiffness can be decreased (and therefore muscle elasticity and exibility can be increased) through a dynamic warm-up. By increasing the temperature of the muscle through activities like light jogging, fast walking, skipping, lunging, or doing bodyweight squats, we can make our muscles more supple and improve our ability to move freely.  119\nWhat you're feeling while you warm up is a thixotropic effect. Thixotropy is the ability of tissue (such as muscle) to become more pliable or liquid after motion and to return to a stiffer gel-like state when resting. Basically, movement decreases muscular stiffness. This is why your low back or legs feel stiff after you sit in a chair all day, but you feel much better after you get up and walk around for a few minutes."}, "258": {"text": "Think about opening a container of yogurt. When you peel back the lid, the yogurt is sometimes clumped together. After you stick your spoon into the cup and stir the yogurt around, it becomes more gel-like. This is an example of a thixotropic effect. Just like the yogurt being stirred by the spoon, your muscles become less stiff and more responsive to movement.\nA generalized warm-up that elevates the heart rate and improves blood ow to the muscles is recommended for all athletes before training or competition to promote this thixotropic effect. If you are a barbell athlete, your warm-up can include walking lunges, leg or arm swings, or even a fast-paced walk."}, "259": {"text": "Following this general warm-up should be a sport-specic warm-up that includes movements tailored to your particular training/sport. For example, if your workout includes clean and jerks, you might start with an open bar and perform a number of shrugs and high pulls followed by some full-depth front squats before adding weight. The combination of a general and a specic warm-up is key for improving exibility, mobility, and movement quality to perform at your best and be as safe as possible."}, "260": {"text": "Every aspect of a training or rehab program has a purpose. At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself why you are implementing each exercise, including stretches. For years, we have been taught that if a muscle is tight, we need to stretch it to return it to what a textbook would tell us is 'normal.'\nI hope you now understand that those who are in pain do not have 'normal' hamstring exibility. Their bodies are reacting differently due to pain/injury, which creates a facade of 'muscle tightness.'  120  For this reason, someone with back pain can't just stretch away the limited hamstring exibility."}, "261": {"text": "Also, just because someone has 'tight' hamstrings does not mean they will develop back pain.  121  In fact, some athletes have short or stiff hamstrings for a reason. Remember, muscle length testing was developed years ago based on the idea that there is a 'normal' or ideal range of muscle length for optimal movement and safety. Blindly prescribing longduration stretching for an athlete's hamstring stiffness just because they appear 'abnormal' on paper is not always a good idea. I'm going to share a little secret with you: most elite athletes have abnormal traits that give them the ability to do things most of us 'normal' people cannot ."}, "262": {"text": "Instead, I urge you to address what you nd in these athletes in a different manner than we have in the past. For those with back pain, treat the 'why.' Understand that the 'tight' hamstrings are a reaction to the pain, and we need to learn how to stabilize the low back, turn the inactive glutes back on, and x the movement pattern that led to the injury in the rst place to nd a lasting x! For an athlete with 'tight hamstrings,' learn to incorporate a proper warm-up that includes dynamic movements and short-duration stretching (if warranted) that will improve mobility and movement quality without a decrease in performance. I hope this content empowers you to make more educated choices on when and if to include stretching in the future."}, "263": {"text": "1. T. E. Dreisinger and B.

Well, in 2001, a group of researchers in Japan took a close look at the hip joint. While a majority of\nthe subjects had 'normal' hip sockets, close to 40 percent did not!  1  Some people have hip sockets that open to the side, while others point more forward.

In fact, a strain (which describes small tears in the muscle bers) in any of the adductor muscles is thought to be one of the most common forms of groin-related pain.

The iliopsoas is comprised of two muscles: the iliacus and psoas major. It may surprise you to learn that this is the only muscle group that directly connects the spine to the lower body.

An injury to the common hip exor tendon (called tendinopathy ) could even be present! While you may hear several medical diagnoses given to an injury in this area-hip exor strain, iliopsoas syndrome, snapping hip syndrome, and so on-it is almost always due to overuse as opposed to a specic one-time tear, which is seen more often with adductor strains.  13"}, "343": {"text": "However, we must not be too quick to label pain on the front side of the hip as a hip exor strain.

The glute medius is a large fan-shaped muscle that runs from the lateral part of your pelvis (iliac crest) and connects with a single tendon to your femur.  25  The glute minimus is a smaller muscle that ts right behind the glute medius and also attaches to the femur."}, "352": {"text": "In most anatomy classes, students are taught that these two muscles are the main abductors of the hip and that when activated, the medius/minimus muscles move the thigh away from the midline of the body.

The middle and anterior portions work together to initiate lateral leg movement (abduction), which is then completed by the tensor fasciae latae (TFL). Along with beginning any lateral leg movement, the anterior bers of the glute medius can create or limit pelvis rotation."}, "354": {"text": "However, when you're on your feet, these muscles take on a slightly different role. When you run, lunge, or squat, the glute medius and minimus act together to steady the hip joint (limiting knee cave) and keep the pelvis from tipping, rotating, or shifting from side to side. This allows the larger muscles around the hip (TFL, glute max, hip exors, hamstrings, and so on) to create movement. For this reason, the glute medius/minimus muscles are similar in function to the rotator cuff muscles of the shoulder. Both muscle groups act as stabilizers for their respective joints.\nContrary to what you may have learned in anatomy class, your lateral glute muscles are more of a movement stabilizer than a prime mover of the lower body. This understanding helps guide us in creating more efficient training and better corrective exercises for the hip joint."}, "355": {"text": "As I explained earlier, most people with lateral hip pain have a gluteal tendinopathy injury. If you skip ahead to the Knee Pain chapter, specically the section on patellar and quad tendinopathy (see here to here), I explain there that tendon injuries occur due to relative overuse or overload of these tissues. They can occur in an untrained individual who starts a high-intensity program or even in an elite athlete who deconditions their body while on vacation and then jumps right back into 'normal' training. If the body is not allowed to recover after a rapid increase in the intensity and/or frequency of training, the tendon becomes 'reactive,' and the injury process begins."}, "356": {"text": "Gluteal tendinopathy occurs due to two main types of overloading: excessive stretching of the tendon bers (much like stretching a rubber band) and/or too much compressive force (from the tendon being smashed into the tissues/bone underneath).

Not until the athlete moves into a deep exed position does the femur run into the front of the hip socket, generating pain.

For example, pain around the kneecap could be traced to degrading cartilage under the patella, to a bone bruise, or even to irritation of nearby tissues like the superior fat pad or the retinaculum (sections of the tough, brous capsule that surrounds the joint). Fortunately, you don't need to know with 100 percent certainty which specic anatomical tissue is at fault to take the rst steps toward becoming pain-free!"}, "468": {"text": "Let's talk briey about the mechanics of the knee joint. As you move your knee, your kneecap travels within a small notch in your femur called the patellar groove . This bony connection (called the patellofemoral joint ) is placed under tremendous stress during a deep squat. Fortunately, the human body is uniquely designed for such movements! If you were to look closely at this joint, you would nd that the kneecap and femur are lined with some of the thickest cartilage in the entire body. This dense layer of tissue distributes the load and keeps the joint healthy.\nPATELLA IN PATELLAR GROOVE"}, "469": {"text": "As your knee bends and straightens, the tissues (muscles, fascia, ligaments, and retinaculum) that surround the joint keep the patella in a stable position. If you perform a squat or catch a snatch in a deep receiving position and maintain your knees in alignment with your feet, the load is evenly distributed across the patellofemoral joint. If the knee does not track in this ideal manner and begins to wobble from side to side, however, problems can eventually arise.\nThe most common reason strength athletes develop pain around the kneecap is a lack of ability to control for rotation at the knee (i.e., demonstrating poor knee stability when lifting). If your knee wobbles as you squat, catch a clean, or stand up in a deadlift, the patella shifts and tilts off-axis in the patellar groove.  5  This wobbling not only creates uneven pressure on the underside of the bone but also places excessive strain on the surrounding tissues that connect to the kneecap."}, "470": {"text": "Victoria Futch, \u00a9 Bruce Klemens\nKnee cave squat."}, "471": {"text": "Overall quadriceps force\nThink of this problem like a train being pulled off the tracks.

The TFL and IT band work together to move the leg, one of those motions being internal or medial rotation of the femur.\nILIOTIBIAL (IT) BAND\nThe diagnosis of IT band syndrome (ITBS) is usually given when someone experiences pain on the lateral part of the knee, often over the prominent bony part of the femur called the lateral femoral condyle . Symptoms usually get worse over time and are not linked to one specic incident or trauma (like getting hit on the side of the leg). While this pain can start off dull and achy, it often progresses to a sharp pain that can be pinpointed to one specic area on the lateral surface of the knee where the band inserts. Some people even complain of a painful popping or snapping sensation at times."}, "473": {"text": "Historically, ITBS has been thought to be a repetitive overuse injury typically found in runners. An athlete suffering from this injury commonly experiences more pain when they run for longer periods. In fact, ITBS has been found to encompass upwards of 12 percent of all running-related injuries.  6  However, it also appears in those participating in weight training. The exact reason for the development of this pain is debated; some people blame it on excessive friction, while others believe it is a compression issue. Let me explain.\nThe initial thinking was that when the IT band is excessively tight, it shifts forward and backward repetitively over the lateral femoral condyle as the knee bends and straightens.  7  This shifting causes friction underneath the IT band that eventually results in inammation and pain."}, "474": {"text": "However, recent research has shown that the IT band is, in fact, rmly attached to the distal femur by strong brous strands, preventing it from rolling over the condyle as previously thought. In fact, the rolling movement that many see when the knee is exed and straightened is not a true movement but instead is a shifting in the tension of the IT band. As the knee bends, tension shifts from the anterior to the posterior bers of the IT band.\nFor this reason, most experts now believe that the symptoms of pain are not due to friction underneath the band but instead to compression of a layer of highly innervated fat (fat that contains a lot of nerve endings).  8 Thus, it is not the IT band itself but the tissue underneath that is generating pain at the lateral knee. Medically, this is classied as a form of enthesopathy."}, "475": {"text": "So now you know that compression is the main anatomical cause of IT\nband pain. How does this compression start? It all comes down to the way you move. Just like patellofemoral pain syndrome, research has linked\nproblems in controlling rotational force at the knee with ITBS. In fact, studies have shown that athletes with IT band pain showed more knee\ninternal rotation (knee cave) when their foot hit the ground compared to those without pain.  9  By now, you may be noticing a trend in how injuries occur at the knee.\nPatellar/Quad Tendinopathy\nWhen it comes to understanding patellar and quad tendon pain, things are a bit more complicated. Let's start by discussing a little anatomy.\nA tendon is essentially a brous band of tissue that connects muscle to bone. The patellar tendon runs from the kneecap (patella) to the tibial"}, "476": {"text": "tuberosity (the prominent bony part of your shin bone).

Every time you place stress\non your body (such as when working out), tissue is broken down and then regenerated. Over time, this natural replenishing process is how strength\nis built.\nIn your tendons, this process is largely controlled by small cells called that are dispersed among aligned bers called\ntenocytes collagen\n-type 1\ncollagen, to be exact. Tenocytes react to the forces and loads placed on the tendon and adapt the cellular makeup of the tissue (called the\n) accordingly. Depending on several factors, such as extracellular matrix\nhow intensely you have trained over your years as an athlete, which medications you take, and whether you have diabetes, your body will\nhave adapted your tendon to a certain set point of strength, known as its\n.\nload tolerance level"}, "478": {"text": "Training loads placed on the tendon that do not severely exceed this set point create a cellular response in the tendon that will return to normal in two to three days given proper recovery.

A spark is lit, and the injury process begins."}, "479": {"text": "Young athletes (under the age of 30) who are involved in sports that require sudden explosive and repetitive movements of the knee are the most susceptible to developing an injury at the quad or patellar tendon. Movements that use the tendons of the knee as a spring, such as a jump, place signicantly more load on those tendons than a slower movement, like a squat. This is why sports such as basketball and volleyball that involve a lot of jumping have such a high incidence of this injury, hence the term 'jumper's knee.'\nInterestingly, long-distance runners usually don't get diagnosed with patellar tendinopathy because there isn't a high enough load on the tendon to generate pain. In contrast, jumping (double and single leg) places a lot of stress on the patellar tendon.  11"}, "480": {"text": "Of the two tendons at the knee, the patellar tendon is the more commonly injured. However, patellar and quad tendon pain are both prevalent in sports such as weightlifting and CrossFit due to the high forces that are sustained during the repetitive ballistic movements of the snatch and clean, as well as nonweighted repetitive movements like box jumps.\nHistorically, tendon injuries have been separated into two categories: tendinitis and tendinosis.  12  The itis ending refers to an acute injury caused by inammation. The osis ending traditionally means that the problem is due to the tendon degrading and becoming weak. Medical practitioners often throw out the word tendinitis when referring to a recently painful injury and tendinosis when referring to more chronic tendon injuries."}, "481": {"text": "However, recent research has challenged the idea that the inammation commonly seen with tendon pain is a main driver of the injury and the pain.  13  Furthermore, leading researchers in the eld of tendon injuries now believe that tendonitis and tendinosis are not mutually exclusive but are different parts of the same injury process. Therefore, when we speak about tendon injuries, it is advised to use the term tendinopathy rather than tendonitis or tendinosis .\nThe most practical way to understand how tendon injuries occur comes from the Continuum of Tendon Pathology by renowned expert Jill Cook.  14  This model describes a sequence with three overlapping stages of injury:\n1. Reactive tendinopathy\n2. Tendon disrepair\n3. Degenerative tendinopathy\nProgression from one stage to the next is met with a decreasing ability to recover to the prior healthy state."}, "482": {"text": "As mentioned before, when exposed to an overload of any nature, there is a short-term exaggerated response of the cells that make up the\ntendon. Specically, small proteins called proteoglycans\nood the extracellular matrix, causing the tendon to become swollen and painful.\nAgain, this swelling is not caused by inammation-a big reason why ice and rest alone won't x the injury!  15\nSo how exactly does this overload occur? If preventing tendon injuries was as simple as not lifting more than a certain amount of weight or not lifting too frequently, how is an elite weightlifter able to pull two-a-day training sessions multiple times per week without developing pain while a novice athlete might develop this injury after training for only a few weeks? It all comes down to the individual and the relative load capacity of their tendons. Let me explain."}, "483": {"text": "The human body does an amazing job of adapting to the stresses applied to it. Depending on the kind and amount of stress, the cells in our tendons can respond positively or negatively. In response to acceptable training loads, our tendons become stronger by increasing in stiffness.  16 An elite athlete who performs explosive and heavy barbell training every day with minimal rest can do so because they have deliberately conditioned their tendons over years to withstand high levels of stress. By routinely subjecting their tendons to high levels of load through proper training programs, elite athletes are able to raise the load tolerance level of their tendons.\nIf a relatively untrained athlete tries to perform the same higher-level training of an elite athlete, they can spark a 'reactive' phase of injury-the short-term exaggerated response of the cells due to the unexpected overload. This common scenario takes place when athletes have one extremely difficult training session or jump from a three-days-a-week program to daily lifting."}, "484": {"text": "The spark that sets off the reactive phase for a novice can also occur in an elite athlete. If an athlete who is able to tolerate a lot of load day in and day out took a long break from training (two or more weeks, for example) and all of a sudden jumped right back into a relatively normal training program ('normal' being relative to what they were used to), they would subject their tendons to a signicant amount of unexpected stress. This is because their tendons would have become somewhat deconditioned over the extended break, adapting their tissues to a lower load capacity level.\nThere is no set amount of weight or number of reps of any drill that will automatically trigger this injury response; it comes down purely to whether an individual's tendon load capacity has been exceeded. Basically, any unexpected loading on the tendon can trigger a reaction, and the tendon can subsequently thicken in an attempt to handle the stress.  17  At this time, an athlete may experience pain as well as a small amount of swelling around the tendon."}, "485": {"text": "Now, here's the good thing: this process is reversible if properly managed. Researchers believe that reactive tendons have the potential to return to their normal healthy state within a few weeks if the initial training load is signicantly reduced and proper rehabilitation steps are taken.  18  However, if someone continues to train past this point of reactivity, the tendon will enter the disrepair stage as it continues to thicken in an attempt to heal itself. In fact, researchers have found this exaggerated repair process can cause the patellar tendon to double in thickness (from around 4 to 8 millimeters) as a protective response.  19  In reaction to the continued overload, more and more proteoglycans ood the extracellular matrix, drawing in water, which eventually starts to disrupt the architectural struts (collagen) that make up the tendon. At this point, we also see new blood vessels and nerves growing in the tendon, which may play a part in creating pain.  20"}, "486": {"text": "If the proper steps are not taken to address the injury at this time, the disorganized collagen starts to break down even further and die off as the injury enters the third stage, degeneration. Unfortunately, it is very hard to distinguish whether a tendon is in disrepair. To make matters worse, you may not even know that your tendon has slipped into the third stage because the degenerated part of the tendon doesn't elicit pain.\nSo how do we gure out which stage of injury a tendon is in? What researchers like Cook have found is that tendon pain is primarily a symptom of the reactive stage. For this reason, if you are currently experiencing patellar or quad tendon pain, you can stage your injury into an even simpler two-phase model of either 'reactive' or 'reactive on disrepair/degeneration' tendinopathy.  21"}, "487": {"text": "Let's say this is the rst time you've experienced patellar tendon pain. The day after a really difficult training session, your tendon hurt so badly that you were forced to limp around. Because this is an acute (brand-new) episode of tendon pain, you're likely experiencing the rst stage of reactive tendinopathy.\nHowever, let's say this is not the rst time you've experienced patellar tendon pain. You had a small are-up last year and another a few months ago. You took a few weeks off, and the pain eventually went away, but it keeps coming back. Due to the chronic nature of these symptoms, you are likely experiencing a case of reactive on disrepair/degeneration tendinopathy.\nNORMAL, REACTIVE, AND REACTIVE ON DISREPAIR"}, "488": {"text": "When a tendon experiences continued episodes of overload, degradation can begin, but the entire tendon doesn't just die off. If you looked deep into the tendon, you'd notice small 'islands' of degenerated collagen tissue dispersed among healthy tendon tissue. These islands are unable to bear load. They usually lose tensile strength and springlike capacity, which renders them 'mechanically deaf,' as Cook says.  22\nThink of these islands of degenerated patellar or quad tendon bers as holes in donuts. The holes are surrounded by healthy tissue. However, research has shown that the body will adapt and 'grow' more normal tendon tissue around these dead spots in an effort to recover lost strength.  23"}, "489": {"text": "As noted earlier, these degenerated 'holes' in the tendon do not create pain.  24  It is not until the surrounding portion of healthy tissue becomes overloaded and slips into the reactive phase (in the exact same way a perfectly healthy tendon would) that pain can develop in a degenerated tendon. This is why someone could have a very degenerated tendon without experiencing any pain symptoms.  25\nGood ways to differentiate between reactive tendon pain and reactive on disrepair/degeneration tendon pain (other than a history of symptoms) are how intense the pain is, which exact mechanism set off the injury, and how long it takes to recover. For example, a truly reactive tendon is very painful and swollen. It is sparked by a severe overload, such as an extremely difficult training session lled with plyometric exercises like box jumps."}, "490": {"text": "On the other hand, a reactive on disrepair/degeneration tendon can be sparked by much less dramatic activity overload and often isn't accompanied by much swelling. Pain from this particular tendinopathy can resolve in as little as a few days with proper rest, whereas truly reactive tendons can take four to eight weeks to heal.  26  Understanding which stage you're in will dramatically affect how you manage the injury."}, "491": {"text": "Those with patellar tendinopathy typically complain of tenderness and pain at the connection point of the kneecap and patellar tendon, called the inferior pole of the patella .

Remember this term; it will be an important part of how we x this injury.\nInterestingly enough, the patellar and quad tendons are also placed under considerably more load in a very deep squat where the knee must move forward over the toes.

Doing so requires expert assessment skills and often expensive scans of the knee joint. Luckily, you don't need to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars to take the rst steps toward understanding and addressing your pain.\nWhat causes knee pain?

If they exceed that threshold, however, injury occurs and pain sets in."}, "495": {"text": "Sometimes the mechanism that triggers an injury is blatant. Take, for instance, a powerlifter who is going for a heavy PR during a competition. One of their knees collapses into extreme valgus, and they tear every ligament in their knee. Other times the trauma is slowly applied over months or years through micromovements that cannot be seen with the naked eye. For example, I have worked with many athletes who developed knee pain due to a side-to-side imbalance in hip rotation. Even to a seasoned coach, their lifting technique looked sufficient. What the coach couldn't see, however, was that limited hip internal rotation in one leg was creating microtrauma at the knee joint that eventually led to the development of pain."}, "496": {"text": "While pain may strike at a specic moment, nontraumatic knee pain is usually the result of something that has been building for some time. The signs of injury are often present even before symptoms appear. For example, numerous research studies have found a connection between knee problems (like patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome, and even the development of osteoarthritis) and movement problems such as excessive hip adduction (thigh moving toward the midline of the body) and internal rotation.  28\nThis means that while you may have experienced pain for the rst time after a heavy squat workout last week, the cause of the injury may have been building up for a while.

Rather than take a medical approach to analyzing the body, we are going to go through a movement-based screening process to uncover the cause of your pain.

In the weeks leading up to an important national competition, she begins to feel pain in her right knee -a dull ache around the inside of her kneecap. At rst, she felt it only when lifting heavy, but it has progressed to the point where she feels it on almost every lift. Despite endless foam rolling, the pain never seems to go away, so she decides to see her family doctor. After listening to Selena's story, the doctor gives her a diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, gives her a prescription for anti-inammatories, and tells her to cut back on lifting for a few weeks.\nDoes this story sound familiar to you?"}, "500": {"text": "While rest and medication often decrease symptoms, they do nothing to address why the pain started in the rst place.

During her bodyweight squat, everything looked great. She began with a sufficient hip hinge and controlled her body to full depth and back to the standing position with optimal technique.\nHowever, when I asked her to perform a simple single-leg squat, things started to break down.

For example, some clinicians believe that knee pain can be caused by weakness in the VMO (inner quad muscle) based on research showing inhibition of this area of the quad in some subjects with patellofemoral pain syndrome. Due to the way its bers run, the VMO works in sync with the lateral quads (vastus lateralis) to stabilize the kneecap and keep it tracking in proper alignment. For this reason, improper ring of this muscle is associated with tracking problems of the kneecap.

An 'open chain' exercise is performed without bearing weight (such as a seated knee extension). A 'closed chain' exercise is performed while bearing weight (such as a squat).\nClosed chain exercises have two distinct advantages over open chain movements for xing a biomechanical dysfunction. First, closed chain movements often create less compression and irritation on the patellofemoral joint. Let me explain why."}, "531": {"text": "Many people assume that the entire kneecap remains in constant contact with the femur during movement. However, nothing could be further from the truth! As the knee exes, the amount of contact between the back of the kneecap and the femur is constantly changing.  43  The more your knee bends, the more contact there is between these two bones, and any force placed on the knee can therefore be distributed over a greater surface area.\nSEATED KNEE EXTENSION"}, "532": {"text": "If you're doing an exercise like a seated knee extension (open chain), your knee is moving from a exed to an extended position. This means the amount of contact between the kneecap and femur in the groove is constantly getting smaller. The contraction of the quads to extend the lower leg pushes the kneecap into the femur, causing more compression. Therefore, the contraction of the quads places a high amount of compressive force on the joint that is distributed over a very small area under the kneecap. If the area under the kneecap is already inamed and irritated, an exercise like this will only make things worse."}, "533": {"text": "For this reason, you want to stick with exercises that can strengthen your quads but also spread the force of the joint compression across a greater surface area under the kneecap. Closed chain exercises have been shown to allow for more optimal loading and better tracking of the kneecap in the femoral groove than open chain exercises, potentially leading to less joint irritation for those dealing with certain kinds of knee pain.  44  For most people, a closed chain exercise such as a bodyweight squat to a pain-free depth is a better choice than an open chain knee extension."}, "534": {"text": "If squatting to full depth is painful for you, modifying your depth early in the rehab process will be necessary. Never push into pain for the sake of achieving a full-depth squat.

Research has shown that compression of the patella increases as the knee bends, maxing out at around 90 to 100 degrees of knee exion.  45  For this reason, you want to start with bodyweight squats to a pain-free depth. As you work toward squatting to full depth without knee pain, you can slowly reintroduce the barbell (or any other load, such as a goblet squat) into your training.\nThe second reason closed chain exercises are more optimal than open chain exercises for rehabbing a biomechanical dysfunction is that they\ntake a holistic approach to treating the full body but in a functional"}, "535": {"text": "manner.

However, this isn't always the case. For example, researchers have found poor mechanics to occur when running (a movement where the muscular demand at the hip is relatively low) in athletes dealing with IT band pain.  48  Studies have shown that people with patellofemoral pain often demonstrate poor landing strategies with single-leg hops.  49\nSo what does this mean?"}, "537": {"text": "It means that improving knee control involves more than just strengthening weak muscles.

They incorporate lateral hip strength and lower body stability through movements that improve proprioception (the ability to sense and be aware of body position) and neuromuscular control (the unconscious response of the body to maintain stability). Therefore, a combination of strength exercises with movement reeducation is the optimal solution for improving knee stability.  50\nI want to introduce to you a ve-step process for improving knee stability:\n1.

If the ankle, knee, and hip bow outward, the entire foot moves into a full arched position. If the ankle, knee, and hip fall inward, the foot collapses and the arch attens out. This means you can manipulate the position of your feet by setting your hips and knees in a good position before initiating a squat.\nTRIPODFOOT\nCreating a good arch in your foot forms what is called a 'tripod foot.' The three points of the tripod are the heel, the base of the rst toe, and the base of the fth toe."}, "539": {"text": "The foot is like a three-wheeled motorcycle.

Similarly, stability and power are lost when the foot is out of position (e.g., when the arch collapses).\nTake off your shoes and assume a squat stance. Notice the position of your feet. Do you have equal weight on each of the three tripod points? Is your arch in a good position, or has it already collapsed? The goal is to become aware of how your feet are functioning.\nFrom this position, squeeze your glutes and drive your knees out to the side while keeping your big toes in contact with the ground.

Contrary to the advice of your doctor, not everyone has to stop training to x a\ntendinopathy problem.\nIf you're dealing with tendon pain, you are in a reactive stage, regardless of whether it is the rst 'reactive' stage or later 'reactive on disrepair/degeneration' stage. This pain is due to one simple mechanism: overload.

You never want to rest a tendon completely!\nThe strength of your tendons follows the simple motto of 'if you don't use it, you lose it.'  53  If you take away all loading and only rest for a few weeks, you will set yourself up for the pain to eventually return. Tendinopathy occurs because your training surpassed your current load tolerance level. If you completely rest your body, it will adapt, and the tolerance level of your patellar and/or quad tendon will drop (because minimal load is being placed on it), making it even easier to overload when you return."}, "560": {"text": "On the other hand, you don't want to ignore pain and continue pushing through painful exercises. If you do, the injury will only continue to get worse, and structural changes will eventually take place in the tendon.

Therefore, it isn't practical for everyone to stop training. You must, however, make a change to your training program (along with adding some of the exercises discussed later).

Regardless of which variable you choose, change only one at a time and wait to see how your body responds. Everyone will be slightly different, so there is no golden rule.\nIf your body does not respond well to this modication in training with the addition of corrective exercises, or if the pain has been ongoing for more than a few months (meaning your injury may be in the degenerative phase), it is highly recommended that you cease training and consult with a sports physical therapist or an orthopedic specialist (MD or DO)."}, "562": {"text": "Exercise is the best treatment for any type of tendon pain.

They also spark the ability of the quad to kick back on, as it is usually inhibited in strength output due to pain (called cortical inhibition ).  54  Think about it like this: If, every time you performed a jump, you experienced pain, your brain eventually would say, 'Stop it!' This is why someone who has been dealing with tendon pain for a long time sees decreases in performance.

As I mentioned, routine loading can increase a tendon's stiffness, which gives it a higher capacity to bear load.

First, you can control the depth and limit pain by setting the box to a predetermined height. To maintain your balance as you descend into a full-depth squat, your knees must move forward toward (and sometimes over) your toes. While this forward knee position is not inherently dangerous for someone with healthy knees, the inclined shin angle can increase load on the patellar and quad tendons, creating pain. Performing a box squat to around parallel depth limits forward knee translation, enabling you to load the tendons without pain."}, "574": {"text": "Box squats also decrease the total tension placed on the quad and patellar tendons because a powerful turnaround in the bottom of a free squat (which naturally stores and releases energy via the tendons) is not used. When doing a proper box squat, there is a pause between the descent and ascent. Normally, with a heavy squat, elastic energy is stored in the tendons. The pause eliminates the springlike loading and unloading of the tendons. Simply put, athletes with patellar tendinopathy will be able to tolerate box squats better than they can tolerate regular heavy squats.\nThe setup for the box squat is exactly the same as it is for your regular squat. Set your feet in a stable position. Take a breath and brace your core before initiating the squat with your hips.\nWhile remaining balanced during the descent (barbell tracking over your midfoot when viewed from the side), sit straight down onto the top of the box.

This is not what they are meant for."}, "602": {"text": "Knee wraps, on the other hand, need to be worn sparingly . Research shows that wearing wraps may change your squatting technique by forcing you into a more upright position.  82  This means your powerful hip extensors (glutes) may contribute less to the lift. For this reason, it is recommended that athletes who want to use knee wraps use them only for their heaviest training sessions and/or during powerlifting meets.\nIn the end, using knee wraps or sleeves is a personal decision. Many great barbell athletes do not use either, and some use either wraps or sleeves, depending on the goal of their training session. Knee wraps can be a great accessory to help you lift heavy weight. Remember, though, that knee wraps or sleeves should not be used as a crutch to cover up knee pain!"}, "603": {"text": "1. K. D.

Every time you pick up a barbell from the ground or drive one overhead, a complex network of muscles, ligaments, and bones must work perfectly in sync to keep the joint safe. For the shoulder to remain healthy, it must have sufficient mobility to move into a wide range of positions while being stable enough to maintain those positions.\nIn all my years of working with athletes, I have found the shoulder to be one of the most frequently injured joints. In fact, research shows that it is the most injured joint in those who lift weights either competitively or recreationally.  1  I want to begin this chapter by briey going over the anatomy of the shoulder and covering some of the common shoulder injuries that I see in the weight room."}, "650": {"text": "Before jumping into the potential injuries that can occur at the shoulder, we must discuss its architecture (how the joint is designed) and its function (how the different parts work together to create movement).\nThe shoulder joint, or glenohumeral joint, is considered a ball-andsocket joint and is made up of three bones: the humerus, scapula, and clavicle. The end of the humerus (upper arm bone) is shaped like a small ball that ts into the socket of the scapula (shoulder blade). Unlike the relatively deep ball-and-socket joint of the hip, the socket of the shoulder is very shallow, which is why the joint connection is often compared to a golf ball sitting on a tee."}, "651": {"text": "The shallow shoulder joint connection is often compared to a golf ball sitting on a tee.\n\u00a9\nTK\nThe 'ball' of the humerus is held in place on the 'tee' or socket of the shoulder blade, called the glenoid , by a number of small but very important tissues (ligaments and capsule). These tissues wrap around the joint like a tight-tting glove and form an airtight hold.\nLIGAMENTS AND CAPSULE SURROUNDING THE SHOULDER JOINT\nRight over the top of these ligaments and capsule runs the rotator cuff, a group of four small muscles that begin at the shoulder blade and attach to the humerus. Because these muscles lie close to the joint and act to compress the humerus in the socket as the arm moves, they are considered 'primary stabilizers.'"}, "652": {"text": "Then a number of large muscles attach to the shoulder blade and/or humerus to help move the arm.

This is much easier said than done,\nhowever. As simple as this concept seems, only 25 to 30 percent of your\n'golf ball' is in contact with the 'tee' at any given time.  2  However, a strong and healthy shoulder will maintain the ball of the humerus to within a few millimeters of the center of the socket throughout almost all arm movements.  3"}, "653": {"text": "How is this movement precision possible? It is the result of a perfect interplay of two factors: static and dynamic (or active) forces."}, "654": {"text": "Static forces are the pull or tension created by structures we have no control over, like the ligaments and capsule that surround the joint and the labrum that expands the joint socket. The combination of the tension that these tissues create and the shape of the joint socket is what dictates the degree of 'passive stability' for the shoulder.  4\nIf you've ever seen someone who is 'double-jointed,' that extreme exibility is often due in part to very lax or loose static structures in the shoulders. It should come as no surprise that each of us has slight differences in our anatomy. Some people naturally have more or less ligament/capsular stiffness. Also, the shape/size of the scapular glenoid fossa (the tee in the golf ball analogy) varies from person to person. Some individuals have a deep glenoid fossa, while in others it may be atter, resembling a plate. Both of these factors can have a great impact on the amount of stability a person has."}, "655": {"text": "For example, as you pull a barbell over your head during a snatch or jerk, the shoulder joint capsule tightens or 'winds up' to stabilize the joint and keep the humerus from sliding out of the socket. Those with a lax or loose capsule (or a shallow plate-shaped joint socket) have less natural passive stability and require even more 'active stability' (from the muscles that surround the joint), or they risk injury.\nWhile we obviously can't change how these static stabilizers work short of surgery, we can make sure the muscles that surround the shoulder joint (the active stabilizers) are doing their job. Therefore, dynamic forces are the pull or tension created by muscles-something we do have control over."}, "656": {"text": "As mentioned earlier, the four small muscles that make up the rotator cuff-the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minorsurround the shoulder joint and create compression to maintain the center of the 'ball' on the 'tee' as you move your arm. These muscles work together with the larger muscles that attach to the arm and shoulder blade to produce safe and powerful movement whether you are picking up a bag of groceries or throwing a loaded barbell over your head.\nTo understand how the rotator cuff and prime movers work together to move your scapula and humerus, imagine a young boy helping his father set up a tall ladder. The boy kneels at the base of the ladder, securing it to the ground. The father then pushes the ladder upward, leaning it against the side of their house.

Not only do we need to understand the mechanics of the shoulder joint itself, but we also need to take into account how the shoulder blade is moving. As you move your arm over your head, your shoulder blade moves as well to maintain contact with the humerus.\nReturning to the ladder analogy, think of what would happen if the father decided to grab the ladder and move it to a different part of the house. The ladder could topple over if the boy didn't get up from his kneeling position and move with the ladder to secure it in place again. Just as the boy moves to keep the base of the ladder connected to the ground, the shoulder blade must move to accommodate the changing position of the upper arm bone. This action comes from a number of muscles that connect to the shoulder blade, such as the rhomboids, trapezius, teres major, and serratus anterior."}, "659": {"text": "There is one more important piece of the puzzle: the thoracic spine, or mid-back. Because the shoulder blade basically oats on top of the spine, the shape of the mid-back can dictate the efficiency of its movement (or lack thereof).

This requires a certain amount of thoracic spine extension.\nSCAPULA MOVING ON TOP OF THE THORACIC SPINE"}, "660": {"text": "The architecture of the mid-back is naturally stiff and stable. It has to be stiff because many of the ribs that connect to it provide protection for the vital organs that lie underneath.

When the upper back is rounded and unable to extend fully, the movement of the shoulder blades is limited.  6  An immobile shoulder blade affects the mechanics and stability of the shoulder joint. As you can see, there are many factors behind safe and efficient movement of the shoulder!\nTo wrap up this section, here are the basics of the shoulder complex that you need to remember: If the shoulder blade moves as it should on top of a mobile thoracic spine, the rotator cuff muscles can do their job and maintain sufficient stability of the joint. The arm is then controlled by the large prime movers of the upper body. Basically, if every part performs its function correctly, the 'ball' stays in the middle of the 'tee,' and injury is averted ."}, "661": {"text": "What causes shoulder pain? The simplest answer is that pain is often the result of excessive stress or strain on the small structures that surround the shoulder joint. The normally harmonious shoulder complex can be derailed by a malfunction in one part (e.g., a weak rotator cuff or poor passive shoulder stability). For a strength athlete, pain usually comes from cumulative microtrauma due to three things:\n- Imbalances between the prime movers and primary stabilizers\n- Instability\n- Poor movement and lifting technique\nThe specic injury that is sustained-rotator cuff tendinopathy, labrum tear, subluxation, and so on-depends on how balance and control are lost. Let me explain."}, "662": {"text": "Let's begin by discussing commonly occurring problems from an anatomical perspective. For the shoulder to work correctly, the small primary stabilizers (rotator cuff muscles) must work in balance with the larger prime movers, like the deltoid. If these forces are not properly balanced, the joint loses stability and the mechanics of the shoulder are thrown off.  7\nA common injury that occurs due to an imbalance like this is impingement. Research shows that there are two kinds of impingement: external (or subacromial) and internal.  8  Because these classications are based on where the impingement occurs, the two types often bring out pain in different parts of the shoulder.\nWhen you look at the anatomy of the shoulder joint, you'll notice that there isn't a ton of space between the 'ball' of the humerus and the structures that lie directly above it, like the acromion of the shoulder blade.\nSHOULDER JOINT ANATOMY SHOWING EXTERNAL IMPINGEMENT"}, "663": {"text": "- External impingement describes the pinching of the bursa (a small, uid-lled 'bag') or rotator cuff tendons against the 'ceiling' created by the acromion bone. (The space between the acromion\nand the rotator cuff/soft tissue structures is known as the subacromial space .) It often creates pain on the front of the shoulder as the arm is raised overhead.\n- Internal impingement occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff are pinched between the 'ball' of the humerus and the edge (usually the back side) of the socket 'tee.' It creates pain on the back of the shoulder as the arm is elevated and externally rotated.\nImpingement injuries can also be classied based on the cause of the pain (or pathomechanics ). The pinching of the overlying structures in the joint can happen for two main reasons:\n- Anatomy (primary impingement)\n- Dynamic imbalances (secondary impingement)"}, "664": {"text": "The rst factor is the anatomy of the shoulder blade. The acromion in most people is fairly at or slightly curved. However, in some individuals, this bone has a hooked shape, which can leave less 'free space' for the rotator cuff tendons and bursa as the shoulder moves. If someone who has this type of anatomy pushes through uncomfortable and painful positions, the rotator cuff tendons can become swollen and the subacromial space can become even narrower. Less space means more pinching of these tissues against the bony ceiling of the shoulder. With enough time, this microtrauma can turn into a big problem like a rotator cuff tear."}, "665": {"text": "Unfortunately, we cannot change this anatomy short of surgery. Early recognition of symptoms is the key to getting ahead of this injury before it's too late. Working with a physical therapist or coach to modify your lifting technique to suit your anatomy, such as by taking a wider grip on the barbell for the snatch or jerk, might allow you to continue lifting overhead with less impingement."}, "666": {"text": "Secondary impingement is more common in athletes in my experience. At the start of this chapter, I mentioned that the shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint. That statement isn't 100 percent accurate. You see, when the shoulder moves into extreme ranges of motion (such as when you lift your arm overhead), the arm not only rotates in the joint but also glides slightly forward, backward, and up or down. A secondary impingement doesn't occur because of a structural abnormality but because of a functional problem. Usually, an athlete will have a hard time maintaining adequate shoulder stability with overhead movements. In some cases, excessive movement of the humeral head ('ball') can lead to internal pinching.\nSecondary impingements can be created by\n- Muscle strength imbalances\n- Mobility restrictions\n- Coordination problems (shoulder blade and humerus)\n- Instability"}, "667": {"text": "A muscle strength imbalance is one of the most common reasons for secondary impingement. If the rotator cuff is not ring correctly or is just plain weak, the stronger muscles that surround the shoulder (prime movers) will overpower the primary stabilizers (rotator cuff muscles). If we go back to the ladder analogy, the boy (rotator cuff) must stabilize the base of the ladder for the father (prime movers) to push the ladder up to secure it in place. If the base of the ladder is not secured, the ladder will wobble excessively, and the father will have a difficult time placing the ladder at the right location/height. Although the rotator cuff muscles are small, they have a very big job!"}, "668": {"text": "Mobility restrictions such as stiff lats, stiff pecs, and an excessively stiff thoracic spine can also create impingements. Any one of these restrictions can negatively impact scapula or humerus movement. Mobility restrictions can negatively affect an athlete's overhead barbell or dumbbell lifts. Here's one such example.\nTo maintain proper upper-body tension and stability for pulls and deadlifts, the body must activate the powerful lat muscles (the huge 'V'shaped muscles that run along the sides of the back). These strong muscles not only help create sufficient core stability and torso stiffness but also help maintain shoulder internal rotation to keep the bar close to the body as the barbell is pulled from the oor."}, "669": {"text": "To move the barbell overhead also requires exibility in the lats. To keep the head of the humerus in the center of the joint as the arm moves overhead, the humerus must externally rotate. If the lats are too stiff, the humerus will be unable to achieve adequate external rotation, which could lead to an impingement. Those who have limited overhead mobility due to exibility restrictions yet continue to force their shoulders into poor positions when lifting end up with microtrauma, which can lead to shoulder injury and/or pain."}, "670": {"text": "Proper coordination between the shoulder blade and humerus is crucial for maintaining stability.

Some people are born with 'loose' joints due to lax connective tissue.

This kind of mobility is commonly seen in those who participate in sports that involve performing the same movements over and over, resulting in excessive stretching of the static structures that stabilize the joint.

Joint hypermobility is not inherently dangerous. Plenty of athletes have hypermobility (either congenital or acquired) and go through their entire athletic careers without getting injured. If the rotator cuff fails to control a hypermobile shoulder joint during dynamic movements, however, the shoulder can become unstable, and injury is likely to occur. The ability to dynamically stabilize the shoulder is the difference between functional hypermobility and pathological instability.\nSo how does instability lead to injury when lifting weights? CrossFitters and weightlifters are similar to baseball players and gymnasts in the sense that having the requisite shoulder mobility is paramount. The repetitive nature of lifting weights overhead can put the shoulder at increased risk for injury, especially in the presence of instability. Although you likely won't see a traumatic dislocation during overhead lifting (snatch, jerk, press, and so on), tiny amounts of trauma are sustained at the shoulder if stability is lacking."}, "676": {"text": "Elite weightlifter split jerk.\nAnatoly Pisarenko, \u00a9 Bruce Klemens\nBecause the shoulder is a naturally mobile joint, the location and type of injury can differ from person to person.

If someone has natural hypermobility of the shoulder joint and not enough muscular\ncontrol, the tendons of the rotator cuff can be pinched against the back of the joint socket as they raise their arm overhead.\nInstability can also result in a more serious injury to the labrum, which is a thick piece of tissue that expands or deepens the 'tee' of the shoulder\njoint, allowing for more connection to the arm bone.

Moving poorly, especially under load, increases your risk for injury. The most common technique aw that leads to shoulder pain when lifting occurs when the barbell is pushed or held overhead (e.g., in the snatch, jerk/press, or overhead squat). Let's break down how it happens.\nFor the shoulder joint to remain safe during the snatch, jerk/press, or overhead squat, the wrists, elbows, shoulders/shoulder blades, and extended mid-back (thoracic spine) should be kept in a vertically stacked alignment. With the barbell positioned directly over the back of the neck, the shoulder muscles can work efficiently to stabilize the tremendous weight overhead.

Some appear to have done so as they secure the barbell in the overhead position for two reasons. First, the shoulder blades naturally have to rotate upward to provide stability for the humeri. Second, the upper traps are engaged to help provide tension for the arms as they support the barbell overhead. The appearance of upwardly rotated shoulder blades and engaged upper traps gives the impression that the lifter is actively shrugging their shoulders upward. However, this is often not the case. Excessive shrugging of the shoulders can lead to early fatigue of the supporting musculature that stabilizes the joints. Simply put, overemphasizing a shoulder shrug is an inefficient approach to stabilizing the barbell overhead."}, "681": {"text": "Olympian Chad Vaughn explains this concept by telling athletes to envision doing a 100-meter overhead walking lunge with a barbell. If the shoulders are shrugged upward to support the barbell, the trap muscles will surely fatigue before the 100-meter distance is covered.\nOne of the most common technique aws behind shoulder injuries when lifting overhead is excessive internal or external rotation of the joint.\nAs you raise your arm (or toss a barbell over your head), your shoulder moves into slight external rotation to keep the 'ball' centered on the 'tee.'\nPoor technique can shift the shoulder into excessive rotation to keep the body (and the weight overhead) in balance. If you drop your chest forward\nduring an overhead squat, your arms will reexively move farther behind your head to keep the barbell balanced over the mid-foot.

Instead of trying to diagnose the specic part of the shoulder that may be injured (such as the labrum or rotator cuff), you need to uncover the root cause of the pain.

In fact, for you, performing stretches to create more motion could lead to instability. However, if you were unable to pass this mobility screen, ask yourself, 'Did I feel pain or stiffness when performing this motion?'"}, "739": {"text": "A loss of shoulder internal rotation can be due to many factors, such as limited muscular exibility (stiff or tight soft tissues), excessive tightness in the joint capsule, or poor alignment of the shoulder complex (such as poor posture and muscular imbalances). Decits in shoulder internal rotation can also be caused by natural adaptations from sports, such as the throwing motion in baseball or the hitting motion in volleyball.\nFor example, research has shown that many lifelong baseball players develop a backward 'twist' of the humerus bone (called humeral retroversion ) over time due to the forces sustained during the repetitive overhead throwing motion.  27  Much like twisting and wringing out a wet towel, the humerus twists backward at the growth plate, causing a permanent adaptation to the bone structure. This change creates a situation where the athlete shows excessive shoulder external rotation and very limited internal rotation. It is not pathological or harmful!\nLifelong baseball players can develop a backward  ' twist '  of the humerus."}, "740": {"text": "Regardless of what is limiting your internal rotation, if actively moving into internal rotation is painful, the last thing you want to do is try to\nstretch into that range.

While limited internal rotation may not hinder your bench press, squat, or deadlift technique, it can have a dramatic effect on the quality of your Olympic lifts. For example, sufficient internal rotation of the shoulder is needed to keep the barbell close to the body during the later phases of the pull into the turnover, especially with the snatch lift.

In an effort to combat this obvious technique fault and keep the bar close to the body, athletes often compensate for a lack of internal rotation by rolling the entire shoulder complex forward (excessively moving their shoulder blades).

One of the most popular stretches prescribed to x internal rotation decits is the classic sleeper stretch. You perform this stretch by lying on your side and pushing your shoulder into internal rotation. Ideally, it would bring out a gentle stretch to the back side of the shoulder. This exercise is so popular, in fact, that a number of medical doctors have asked me specically for this stretch for some patients. However, I'm not a big fan of this exercise, and for a few reasons, I caution you against using it.\nSLEEPER STRETCH\nThe rst is that the stretch is easy to perform incorrectly. I often see athletes roll too far onto their shoulder and aggressively crank their hand toward the ground. Doing so places excessive stress on certain tissues of the joint (posterior capsule), which can lead to more problems down the road."}, "743": {"text": "The sleeper stretch also looks very similar to a test used to conrm shoulder impingement injuries, the Hawkins-Kennedy test.

If you took a photo of this test being performed and ipped it on its side, it is a mirror image of the sleeper stretch. Physical therapist Mike Reinold argues that the sleeper stretch closely mimics the Hawkins-Kennedy test, which is designed to elicit pain in someone who has anterior shoulder pain,  28  so he generally recommends against using the sleeper stretch for athletes.\nHAWKINS-KENNEDY TEST\nEven if you do the sleeper stretch correctly, I believe other alternatives may be more effective and generally less irritating to the shoulder.

You can put yourself in a bad position if you blindly perform internal rotation stretches without doing the appropriate\nscreening rst.\nAthletes require just enough mobility to meet the demands of their sport and its required movements. Athletes with extreme mobility walk a thin line between normality and dysfunction. 'Just enough' mobility provides endless movement options and can maximize performance, whereas pushing too much can create instability, leading to uncontrolled movement and putting the athlete on a fast track to injury.\nAsk yourself these questions:\n- Do I have sufficient shoulder internal rotation?\n- If my internal rotation is limited, is it due to pain or stiffness?\n- Do the activities and lifts that I participate in require more internal rotation?\nIf you can navigate your way through these simple questions, you'll be in a much better position to answer the larger question of 'Do I need more internal rotation?'"}, "746": {"text": "Now that you have addressed any mobility and exibility restrictions that may be contributing to your symptoms, it's time to tackle decits in muscular strength, endurance, and coordination that lead to instability and poor mechanics.

It covers a few of my favorite exercises that address these problems.\nMany of the exercises discussed in this section are performed with a paused hold at certain ranges. Pausing allows you to emphasize shoulder stability. Remember, strength is not the same as stability. Strength is the ability to produce force, whereas stability is the ability to limit excessive or unwanted motion. If a muscle is strong but can't maintain adequate tension and can't work in coordination with the surrounding muscles, joint mechanics will break down, and injury can ensue."}, "747": {"text": "Stability also requires muscular endurance.

For this reason, corrective exercises to enhance shoulder stability must also be performed at different angles of shoulder elevation.\nStart by tying a resistance band around a rig or rack. Grab the band and pull it toward you in a rowing motion. Your hand should nish directly in front of your elbow with your arm parallel to the ground.

Because many athletes who need serratus anterior work often have a at upper back, cueing to 'round the upper back' can help you hug your shoulder blades to your torso.\nLastly, think 'rotate shoulder blades around armpits' (the motion of upward rotation). If you have a friend to help, they can assist this motion by pushing on the medial border of your shoulder blade.\nWALL SLIDE WITH PARTNER ASSISTANCE\nThe arms do not need to extend completely to make this drill effective. You've gone too far with the arm elevation if you notice pain in your upper traps or anterior shoulder. If you do it correctly, you'll notice muscle fatigue around your lateral armpit."}, "782": {"text": "Keep your core slightly braced during this motion as it is common to let the low back arch excessively as the arms slide up the wall. Staggering your feet (one in front of the other) and shifting your body weight from the back foot to the front may allow you to complete the appropriate weight shift while keeping your back in a neutral at position.\nAs you elevate your arms, it is normal to see a small amount of upper trap activation. This is expected and desirable as the upper trapezius muscle works hand in hand with the serratus anterior to rotate the scapula upward. But any exaggerated use of the upper traps (seen as a shrugging of the shoulders) is discouraged because it would excessively elevate the scapula and possibly re-create impingement symptoms if you are dealing with shoulder pain. This upper trap compensation is normal, especially in weightlifters and CrossFitters who perform the Olympic lifts."}, "783": {"text": "The traditional wall slide exercise has two small limitations. The rst is that you can raise your arms only so high above your head before your forearms pop off the wall. This limits your ability to work on serratus anterior strength at the end ranges of arm elevation, which is where many barbell athletes truly need it to perform a snatch, press, or jerk. Second, actively pulling your arms back down against the friction of the wall can reinforce overactive pecs, especially the pec minor.\nFor these reasons, try this exercise with a small twist. Assume the same start position but place your hands on top of a foam roller against the wall, holding the roller just above eye level so you don't run out of room during the next step. Again, brace your core slightly as you lean forward and slide your arms up the wall. The roller enables you to slide your arms back to the start position easily, and you don't have to worry about reinforcing an overactive pec minor.\nWALL SLIDE WITH FOAM ROLLER"}, "784": {"text": "Another muscle that commonly becomes overactive in the presence of a weak serratus anterior is the subscapularis, one of the rotator cuff\nmuscles that lies on the anterior, or front, side of your shoulder blade. To reciprocally inhibit or 'turn off' this muscle during the wall slide exercise,\nsimply loop a small resistance band around your arms. Creating external rotation torque (an action performed by the posterior rotator cuff\nmuscles) while you slide your arms up the wall allows you to home in on the serratus anterior in an optimal manner. This resistance band does not\nneed to be super strong; a light band works great.\nWALL SLIDEWITH FOAM ROLLER AND RESISTANCE BAND\nTo progress this exercise, you can start slowly backing your feet away from the wall. A greater lean will increase the challenge for your body to maintain all of the prior cues. Again, staggering your feet during this exercise can help ensure that you don't end up over-recruiting your pec minor muscles by dragging your arms down from the elevated position."}, "785": {"text": "Recommended sets/reps: 2 or 3 sets of 10 to 20 reps"}, "786": {"text": "At rst glance, the few exercises described here may not appear that difficult to perform.

While the rehab plan never focuses solely on the specic site of pain, pinpointing where the symptoms are felt can give us insight into the injury mechanism and lead us to the most efficient path for xing it."}, "814": {"text": "Let's start with the lateral elbow. The bony nub on the outside of your elbow (the lateral epicondyle) is the common attachment site for your forearm extensor muscles. Historically, pain in this area has been referred to as 'tennis elbow' or lateral epicondylitis. However, in recent years, many experts have recommended moving away from these two terms for a few reasons.\nLATERAL ELBOW ANATOMY\nFirst, inammation (which the itis ending of the word tendinitis refers to) has not been found in many cases of lateral elbow pain.  3  Second, many people develop this injury without ever having played tennis!

The pain is often attributed to tendinopathy, degrading overuse of the tissues similar to a patellar or quad tendon injury."}, "815": {"text": "Injury to this part of the elbow often brings out tenderness when the spot just below the lateral epicondyle (where the large extensor tendons of the forearm run and insert) is poked. Gripping activities also often recreate pain, especially when using a palm-down grip or doing a lift that requires rotating the hand from palm-down to palm-up, such as a biceps curl.  4\nMany people are confused by the notion that gripping movements can re-create pain at the lateral elbow. Isn't gripping performed by the forearm exor muscles on the opposite side of the arm? The answer is yes."}, "816": {"text": "The muscles on the anterior side of the forearm have the ability to ex the wrist (such as performing a wrist curl) and ex the ngers (making a st).

If the wrist exors red and the extensor muscles stayed silent, any gripping activity would be difficult because the wrist would be curled into extreme exion.\n- 5  This means the harder you grip, the more load you place on the common extensor tendon that originates on the lateral elbow.\nGRIPPING BARBELL HELD AT WAIST\nMedial Elbow\nShifting to the other side of the elbow, we nd another bony nub called the\nmedial epicondyle"}, "817": {"text": ", which is the common attachment site for a number of the forearm exor muscles.

If any of these movements re-create pain in your elbow, I recommend that you see a medical doctor or other rehabilitation specialist for an evaluation. If you do not notice any changes in your symptoms when doing these neck movements, try these next few screens to determine which nerve may be the source of your pain."}, "822": {"text": "Start with the ulnar nerve that runs along the inside of your elbow.

Over time, irritation to this nerve can even progress to the point where your grip strength becomes limited."}, "824": {"text": "Here's how to test if your medial elbow pain is possibly due to an injury of the ulnar nerve. With your wrist in a straight 'neutral' position, bend your elbow as much as you can, as if doing a biceps curl, and hold this posture for one minute. You can also take the thumb of your pain-free arm and push hard into the inside of your elbow, just above the medial epicondyle. This over-pressure will compress the ulnar nerve that runs underneath. If either of these tests reproduces your symptoms, it is positive for an injury to the ulnar nerve.  10\nULNAR NERVE TEST (BICEPS CURL WITH OVER-PRESSURE)"}, "825": {"text": "Another nerve that can become injured and create elbow pain is the radial nerve. As this nerve runs down the lateral arm and crosses the elbow joint, it moves through a small passageway between tissues called the radial tunnel . Just like the ulnar nerve on the opposite side of the elbow, the radial nerve can become compressed and pinched in this area, leading to what is called radial tunnel syndrome . Entrapment of the radial nerve often mimics lateral epicondylalgia, causing a deep aching or burning pain that can extend from the lateral elbow into the hand.  11\nRADIAL NERVE ANATOMY AT ELBOW\nIf you have lateral elbow pain, try this test. Start by taking the hand of your pain-free arm and placing it on the opposite shoulder. Pull down slightly on your shoulder to try to keep it from shrugging upward during the next portion of the test."}, "826": {"text": "With your symptomatic arm hanging by your side, fully straighten your elbow and turn your hand behind you with the palm facing up. Next, make a st with your ngers clasped over your thumb as if performing a hook grip and curl your wrist slightly, bringing your st toward your forearm.

A positive test will reproduce your lateral elbow pain, and either shrugging your shoulder or tilting your head toward your opposite arm will modify the intensity of that pain.  12\nAs you can see, several injuries can take place at the elbow joint. After going over the basic anatomy of the elbow and the sites where injuries\ncommonly present, we can dive into why pain develops in the rst place.\nTo better understand the cause of your pain, you have to take a step back and look at your whole body.\nKinetic Chain Screening"}, "827": {"text": "Most elbow injuries that occur in the weight room (such as a dislocated elbow) are not catastrophes. They result from wear-and-tear stresses on the body that accumulate over time. These stresses are inuenced by the following factors:\n- Mobility (the ability to move and control your body into optimal positions)\n- Stability (the ability to maintain position and limit unwanted joint motion)\n- Position/technique\nLifting weights places force (called load ) on your tissues and joints. When proper loading schemes are carried out with ideal technique and paired with sufficient recovery and rest, the body adapts and grows in its capacity to handle more and more load. Problems arise, however, when this balanced equation is thrown off due to an issue with any of these factors. When it comes to the elbow joint, poor lifting mechanics and limitations related to mobility and/or stability are often the culprit. For this reason, a thorough evaluation must look beyond the site of symptoms."}, "828": {"text": "I often see frustrated patients who have gone through a lot of unsuccessful treatments because the rehabilitation professional treats only the site of pain, neglecting the shoulder girdle or failing to look at movement/activities that cause pain. When it comes to the elbow joint, failed treatment plans usually encompass exercises directed to the forearm muscles and 'passive' treatments (ultrasound, tape application, or scraping techniques) to the site of pain. While it is not my goal to discredit any of the prior modes of rehab, we are missing the big picture if we don't take a step back and look into other possible contributing factors.\nDo you remember the childhood song that goes, 'The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone, the thigh bone's connected to the hip bone\u2026,' and so on? This innocent melody is something that many medical and rehabilitation professionals could learn from."}, "829": {"text": "There's a saying, 'A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.'

By searching out 'weak links' in areas other than the site of pain, we can uncover all of the contributing factors for why an injury occurred.\nRegardless of where your elbow symptoms present, we must start this process by looking at the joints directly below and above the site of pain: the wrist and shoulder complex.\nELBOW PAIN KINETIC CHAIN"}, "830": {"text": "Creating a stable platform for the barbell when performing a lift like the snatch, jerk, or overhead press requires a certain amount of wrist mobility. Think of the wrist position that a gymnast must assume to do a handstand. The extended wrist position is a requirement for creating a sufficient platform to bear weight, whether a gymnast is stabilizing their body weight in a handstand or a weightlifter is holding a barbell overhead. (Refer to the photos on the next page.) If an athlete is unable to position their wrists in an efficient weight-bearing position while pushing or pulling a barbell or dumbbell, the body is unable to function optimally.\nGymnast wrist position in handstand. \u00a9 Dr. Dave Tilley\nWeightlifter with barbell overhead and wrists extended.

Ideally, you want your wrists to move to a 90-degree 'L' position. If you come up short, it could be due to stiff or short muscles in your forearms or limited wrist joint mobilitythings I'll show you how to x shortly!\nThe next step is to search upstream at the shoulder complex.

Take, for instance, someone performing the Olympic lifts. If the athlete lacks proper shoulder stability, their overhead positioning and control of the barbell during a snatch or clean and jerk will be affected. This less-than-ideal positioning and control can increase stability requirements in the muscles that surround the elbow joint (to keep the bar from falling to the ground), eventually leading to wear-andtear injuries.\nPRAYER TEST\nOVERHEAD SQUAT; BACK VIEW"}, "833": {"text": "In this instance, it wouldn't matter how much effort went into improving the strength of the overworked elbow musculature if the lack of stability at the shoulder was never addressed. It doesn't always take an expert clinician to remove the initial pain. Eliminate the offending activity (as many doctors will say, 'Take two weeks off from barbell training'), prescribe some medication to ease the acute pain, sprinkle in a little light strengthening and stretching of the surrounding muscles, and-BAM!you're feeling better. But was it a complete x, or did you just get a window of temporary relief? I'll let you be the judge."}, "834": {"text": "In this case, strength tests for shoulder external rotation with the arms by the sides and in an elevated position are helpful screening tools.

Then try the same test with your arm elevated, as if making a high ve. Again, try to resist any movement as your friend attempts to push your hand forward in an effort to create shoulder internal rotation.\nAn inability to maintain the starting position without the hands collapsing inward when a force is applied clues us to take a closer look at the shoulder. To perform an in-depth screen on the rest of the shoulder complex, refer to here to here in the Shoulder Pain chapter.\nEXTERNAL ROTATION MANUAL MUSCLE TESTS\nPosition/Technique\nOnce you uncover mobility and/or stability decits at joints above and/or below the site of pain, the next step is to evaluate your lifting technique."}, "835": {"text": "This is another area in which many in the medical community fall short in their injury evaluation process. You can perform all the strength and\nmobility tests you want and spend thousands on an MRI or a CT scan, but if you don't watch how someone moves, you'll never be able to create a\ncomplete analysis.\nLet's return to the back squat example and look at how it could create pain in the medial elbow. While a slightly extended wrist position is\noptimal for creating a sufficient platform to stabilize the barbell overhead, grasping the bar with fully extended wrists can be problematic, especially\nin movements that require a full grip on the barbell. Take, for instance, an athlete performing a back squat who positions their elbows directly\nunderneath the barbell. With their elbows held so low, their only option is to grab the bar with very extended wrists.\nFully extending your wrists like this stretches your forearm exor muscles. In this lengthened position, the exor muscles are unable to"}, "836": {"text": "exert as much force (compared to a 'neutral' straight wrist alignment), meaning that grip strength is automatically reduced.  15\nTrying to maintain a strong grip on the bar with your wrists fully extended increases your risk of overworking these muscles. Fatigue combined with repetitive training can set off a chain of events that culminates in wear and tear of the tendons and the potential for developing medial elbow pain.  16  One of the rst steps in the rehab process, therefore, is to correct the wrist alignment with some simple technique cues. Aligning the wrist in a more neutral position will take pressure off the medial elbow.\nBACK SQUAT WITH OVEREXTENDED WRISTS"}, "837": {"text": "We must also factor in fatigue and how it affects movement quality during certain lifts. Take, for example, a powerlifter who is performing a high-volume day of bench training. If you've ever pushed yourself through a difficult workout, you know very well that fatigue during repetitive activity can produce changes in movement patterns. While your rst set of lifts may look pristine, fatigue eventually sets in, and the quality of your reps starts to degrade.\nSubtle alterations in lifting mechanics can have profound effects in how your body controls and produces force. For example, research has shown that performing bench presses to the point of signicant fatigue leads to a change in technique, decreased strength in the surrounding muscles, and increased forces on the elbow joints.  17  Over time, substitutions in the way you move and subtle decreases in stability due to loss of strength make your body vulnerable to overuse injuries.  18"}, "838": {"text": "For this reason, if you continue to lift while you work to x your elbow pain, it would be wise to manipulate your programming to allow for adequate rest/recovery time and minimize the frequency of repetitive loading so that you can focus on reinforcing proper technique and movement quality.\nBACK SQUAT WITH NEUTRAL WRISTS\nThe Rebuilding Process\nAs you have come to realize by now, there are many different classications of elbow pain. When we take into account the potential\n'weak links' above and below the site of pain (the shoulder and wrist), we nd a number of scenarios for why pain could develop at the elbow. For\nthis reason, there isn't a one-size-ts-all approach to rehabbing an injury to this joint. You must craft an individualized plan to address your specic\nelbow pain."}, "839": {"text": "If you did a thorough job during the screening process, you should have a fairly detailed list of your 'weak links.' This list will help guide your comprehensive approach to xing the injury. (This is called taking a 'global' approach, as opposed to a 'local' approach that addresses only the site of symptoms.) With your list completed, review the Shoulder Pain chapter, and you'll nd help for addressing each factor you've uncovered.\nOne of my favorite exercises that encompasses mobility, stability, and movement coordination at the shoulder complex is the paused scap pullup. Start by hanging from a pull-up bar with a shoulder-width grip. Completely relax your upper body, letting your shoulder blades pull as far out to the sides of your back as possible. If you have stiffness in your lat muscles, this will bring out a gentle stretch up through the lateral armpit (where the muscle runs and attaches to the humerus).\nPAUSED SCAP PULL-UP"}, "840": {"text": "After holding this stretch for 5 to 10 seconds, engage your back muscles by moving your shoulder blades together and down. If you do\nthis correctly, your elbows will remain locked into extension (only your shoulder blades will move as they pull together and down slightly). After\nholding this position for 5 seconds, relax back down into the extended hang position. Perform 2 or 3 sets of 5 repetitions. As your elbow pain\ndecreases, you can eventually add in a full pull-up after the paused scapular retraction.\nThis sequence not only addresses lat exibility but also teaches your body to properly coordinate movement of the upper body by rst setting\nthe shoulder blades into a stable position. Much like the concrete foundation that creates the stability for a house to stand, proper\npositioning and function of the shoulder blade are vital to the performance and long-term health of the elbow joint."}, "841": {"text": "I also like to use the half-kneeling dumbbell or kettlebell press to windmill. While kneeling, hold a weight by your shoulder in a racked position. You can hold your opposite arm out to the side for balance or place it on your torso to give you some feedback for potential rib aring during the pressing motion.\nAfter you press the weight above your head, hold for a second and feel for the muscles on your posterior shoulder contracting to stabilize the joint. Your shoulder blade should be in a stacked alignment with your arm, elbow, and wrist without excessive shrugging in your upper trap muscles."}, "842": {"text": "Next, slowly tip your torso laterally toward the ground while keeping your hand pointed directly toward the sky. This mimics the top-down sequence of a Turkish kettlebell get-up. As you pause in this bottom position, feel for your shoulder blade pulling in toward your spine and the surrounding muscles working hard to stabilize your arm. Finally, slowly rotate back up to the start position, making sure to limit excessive shrugging of your shoulder blade, before lowering the weight back to the front rack position. Perform 2 or 3 sets of 3 to 5 repetitions.\nImproving scapular and shoulder joint stability through exercises like this that target the muscles of the shoulder girdle (the trapezius, rhomboids, rotator cuff, and posterior deltoid, for example) has been shown in research to be a fundamental component in eliminating many symptoms of elbow pain.  19"}, "843": {"text": "While I cannot overstate how important it is to take a global approach to addressing elbow pain, a few local exercises and rehab techniques can be helpful additions to a comprehensive treatment plan. These include forearm strengthening, banded joint mobilization (specically for lateral elbow pain), soft tissue mobilization, and nerve gliding."}, "844": {"text": "Many cases of medial and lateral elbow pain respond well to forearm strengthening.  20  It comes down to choosing the most efficient method of strengthening to t your injury.\nAs discussed earlier, recent research has classied lateral elbow pain as tendinopathy. Isometric exercises (muscle contraction without joint movement) have been shown to be very effective in treating these kinds of injuries in the lower body, such as the use of the Spanish squat for patellar tendinopathy.  21  While more research is needed on the effectiveness of isometrics in upper-body tendon injuries, I have found them to be quite helpful in many cases of lateral elbow pain.  22\nFor this reason, if you have very inamed symptoms at the lateral elbow, try isometric holds and see if they help modify your pain. Position your arm over the edge of a table (or across your thigh, as shown) and hold a light dumbbell in slight wrist extension for 30 to 45 seconds for 4 or 5 reps."}, "845": {"text": "If this exercise is right for your body, these holds should be completely pain-free by the second or third repetition and cause fatigue only in the extensor muscles of your forearm. If the exercise is too easy with the weight you're using, increase the weight until you nd the hold difficult to perform for a full 45 seconds but can still perform it pain-free.\nWhile isometrics can be helpful for decreasing pain levels, you must eventually move to more traditional strength exercises with movement. Wrist curls-into extension for lateral elbow pain or into exion for medial elbow pain-are the simplest to start with. Perform 10 to 15 repetitions with a 3-second concentric raise and a 3-second eccentric lower at a weight you can tolerate for 3 or 4 sets without increasing pain.  23  Tendon injuries often have a delayed response to loading, so make sure the difficulty of the forearm strengthening isn't leading to more pain the next day! As your strength and pain tolerance improve, increase the weight."}, "846": {"text": "Isolated strength work can also be progressed to more functional movements with carries. The amount of load placed on the wrist extensor muscles during either a single-arm 'suitcase' or a double-arm 'farmer' carry (due to the neutral wrist position) will be more easily tolerated during the early rehab process for those dealing with lateral elbow pain than the overhand pronated position needed for a front-loaded barbell lift like a deadlift.\nSUITCASE CARRY WITH KETTLEBELL\nIf you are dealing with lateral elbow pain, you must eventually return to strengthening your wrist extensors in the overhand grip position. An\nexercise I rst saw performed by elite powerlifter Blaine Sumner for this purpose is a rack hold. Start with a barbell positioned around hip height in\na squat rack. Grip the middle of the barbell with one hand. Brace your core and tense all the muscles from your shoulder down to your hand, and"}, "847": {"text": "then lift the barbell a few inches from the rack. Hold the barbell for 10\nseconds before setting it back down; that's one rep. This exercise should be loaded to the point where the tenth rep is very fatiguing but does not\nbring out any prior symptoms of pain.\nBanded Joint Mobilization with Movement\nFor some people, elbow pain can be modied with a joint mobilization exercise. A technique called\nmobilization with movement\n(MWM), developed by physiotherapist Brian Mulligan, is thought to help correct\nfor a positional fault (a problem in alignment and/or movement) of the elbow joint.  24  This technique can be especially helpful for those who experience lateral elbow pain when making a st, grabbing an object and rotating the hand over and back, and/or performing other gripping activities."}, "848": {"text": "To perform the mobilization, place a thick band (between 2 and 4 inches wide) across your forearm just below the crease of your elbow. Lie on your back with your arm by your side, palm down, so that the band is pulling laterally at a 90-degree angle away from your body.\nWith constant tension from the band attempting to pull your arm to the side (creating a lateral joint glide of the elbow joint), perform 10 to 20\nrepetitions of clenching and relaxing your st. You can also hold a small dumbbell in your hand and rotate it back and forth. Make sure to keep\nyour entire arm (other than your hand) at on the ground.\nIf this exercise is right for your injury and you perform it correctly with enough tension in the band, the pain you experience when gripping or\nmoving your hand while holding an object should be instantly eliminated or greatly reduced during and directly after nishing.  25  If you do not nd"}, "849": {"text": "signicant pain relief from this mobilization, don't waste your time performing it because it is likely not right for you."}, "850": {"text": "Soft tissue mobilization can be a helpful addition to treatment for almost any type of elbow pain.  26  Two useful tools are a small ball (lacrosse or tennis ball) and a barbell.\nIf you are dealing with medial or lateral elbow pain, slowly work the ball between the top of a table or bench and your forearm. Roll it around and seek out spots of tissue that feel tender. Once you've arrived at a tender area, pause for a few seconds before pumping your wrist up and down for a minute or so. This active release technique can help improve tissue and joint mobility.\nLACROSSE BALL SOFT TISSUE MOBILIZATION ON WRIST FLEXORS\nIf you lack wrist extension, try retesting your wrist mobility after doing this soft tissue mobilization. You may experience some short-term\nincreases in wrist range of motion."}, "851": {"text": "If you are dealing with symptoms in your posterior elbow or lower triceps, place a barbell in a rack and throw your arm over the top.

Just\nlike the prior exercise with the ball, pause on areas of tenderness before moving your elbow up and down for a minute. Some athletes might\nnotice improved symptoms directly after doing the barbell soft tissue mobilization.\nBARBELL SOFT TISSUE MOBILIZATION ON TRICEPS\nNerve Gliding\nIf you found that nerve testing reproduced your pain, a helpful technique to decrease your symptoms is a nerve glide. Nerve mobilization\ntechniques fall into one of two categories, aiming to either stretch or slide the nerve (relative to the surrounding tissues).  27"}, "852": {"text": "Gliding techniques that stretch the nerve, called nerve tensioning , temporarily increase tension and pressure in the surrounding sheath and may make symptoms worse in some people. On the other hand, 'sliders' that move the nerve place signicantly less tension on the structure and are therefore less aggressive in mobilizing the nerve in a way that will not increase symptoms.  28  The overall goals of using nerve mobilization techniques are to reduce swelling in and around the nerve, increase blood circulation, and help restore the natural movement capabilities and mobility of the nerve, which in turn decreases symptoms.  29\nTo perform an ulnar nerve slider, as shown on the next page, start with your arm out to the side with your elbow straight and your wrist slightly extended (palm up and ngers pointed toward the ground). Next, simultaneously bend your elbow as you pull your arm in front of your body. Keep your wrist in the same extended position during the entire movement. Hold this position for a second before slowly moving back to the start position.  30"}, "853": {"text": "ULNAR NERVE SLIDER\nTo perform a radial nerve slider, start in the same testing position. Use your opposite-side hand to hold your shoulder down. With your arm hanging by your side, fully straighten your elbow and turn your hand behind you with the palm facing up. Next, make a st with your ngers clasped over your thumb as if performing a hook grip and curl your wrist slightly, bringing your st toward your forearm. Then raise your arm to the side while you follow your hand with your eyes. Move only to the point where you feel slight tension in your elbow, and then return to the start position.\nRADIAL NERVE SLIDER\nMake sure you do only a few sliders at a time because overstressing the nerve, even with a less aggravating slider technique, could potentially\nincrease your symptoms. Also limit any excessive stretching of the wrist exor muscles; doing so may irritate the nerve and intensify your\nsymptoms."}, "854": {"text": "If these mobilizations help decrease your symptoms, I recommend performing them every few hours throughout the day.\nFinal Thoughts on Elbow Rehabilitation\nAs you have come to learn, there is no one-size-ts-all approach to xing elbow pain. However, a thorough screening process like the one outlined\nin this chapter can help you develop a program tailored to your body, allowing you to be that much more efficient in addressing your\nsymptoms.\nUnfortunately, there is no quick x. Treatment will almost certainly take more time than you would like, but have patience. Nothing\ncomplicated was ever solved quickly, and the elbow is a much more complicated joint than many people realize.\nIf at any time during this process you experience symptoms that limit your ability to fully straighten your elbow, feel your elbow getting 'stuck' during movement, feel a painful popping or clicking sensation, or have neck pain, I highly recommend seeing a medical doctor or other rehabilitation professional."}, "855": {"text": "1.

The Achilles tendon connects the two calf muscles (larger gastrocnemius and smaller soleus) to the back of the heel (calcaneus bone).

Degenerative tendinopathy\nProgression from one stage to the next is met with a decreasing ability to recover to the prior healthy state."}, "876": {"text": "Cook's model is fairly new and goes against the way many in the medical community view chronic tendon injuries. Contrary to what your doctor may have told you, the term tendinitis isn't technically correct (the ending itis refers to inammation); newer studies have shown that there is no inammation in affected tendons!  3  For this reason, the term tendinopathy is a better description of any tendon injury.  4\nAs mentioned before, when exposed to an overload of any nature, the cells that make up the tendon react with a short-term exaggerated response known as reactive tendinopathy . Specically, small proteins called proteoglycans ood the extracellular matrix, causing the tendon to become swollen and painful. Again, this swelling is not caused by inammation. 5\nThis response can be sparked in a few ways:\n- The rst is acute overload in one specic training session or a group of sessions that were much more intense than normal. In"}, "877": {"text": "this scenario, the tendon experiences loads much higher than it can currently tolerate.\n- Reactive tendinopathy can also occur upon returning to relatively 'normal' training after an extended break, such as a weeklong vacation or a period of recovery from an unrelated injury. In this scenario, the time away from the gym leads to an adaptive lowering of the tendon's load capacity. Jumping quickly back into 'normal' training causes an overload and sparks the exaggerated cellular response.\n- Overload can even occur due to something as simple as a change in footwear-a shoe that provides less support, has stiffer soles, or has a lower heel than your previous pair."}, "878": {"text": "There is no set amount of weight or number of reps of any drill that will trigger this injury response; it comes down purely to whether an individual's tendon 'load tolerance' has been exceeded. Elite athletes place more load on their tendons during their day-in-and-day-out training compared to amateurs in the same sports, yet injury prevalence is not higher for elite athletes. Their tendons have adapted to heavy training loads through good recovery methods combined with excellent programming/training regimens.\nNow, here's the good thing: reactive tendinopathy is reversible if properly managed. If you remove the trigger that caused the overload and allow the tendon to heal with proper rehabilitation principles (which we'll talk about shortly), the tendon is likely to return to its normal healthy self within a few weeks."}, "879": {"text": "However, if the excessive load is not removed and you continue to train through the tendon pain, the injury will progress to the next stage, which Cook calls disrepair. In response to the continued overload, more and more proteoglycans ood the extracellular matrix, drawing in water, which eventually starts to disrupt the architectural struts (collagen) that make up the tendon. If this overload is not halted, the disorganized collagen starts to break down even more and eventually dies off as the injury enters the third stage, degeneration.\nUnfortunately, it is very difficult to distinguish whether a tendon is in disrepair. To make matters worse, you may not even know that your tendon has slipped into the third stage because the degenerated part doesn't elicit pain."}, "880": {"text": "Researchers like Cook have found that tendon pain is primarily a symptom of the reactive (rst) stage. For this reason, if you are experiencing pain in your Achilles, you can characterize your injury using an even simpler twostage model of either 'reactive' or 'reactive on disrepair/degeneration' tendinopathy.  6  Let me explain.\nLet's say this is the rst time you've felt Achilles tendon pain. The day after a really difficult training session, your Achilles hurts so bad you're forced to limp. Because this is an acute (brand-new) episode of tendon pain, you're likely experiencing the initial stage of 'reactive' tendinopathy."}, "881": {"text": "Or maybe this is not the rst time you've felt Achilles tendon pain. You had a small are-up last year and another a few months ago. You took a few weeks off, and the pain eventually went away, but it keeps coming back. Due to the chronic nature of these symptoms, you are likely experiencing a case of 'reactive on disrepair/degeneration' tendinopathy."}, "882": {"text": "When the tendon experiences continued episodes of overload, degradation can begin, but the entire tendon doesn't just die off. If you\nlooked deep into the tendon, you'd notice small 'islands' of degenerated collagen tissue dispersed amid healthy tendon tissue. These islands of\ndegenerated tissue are unable to bear any load. They usually lose tensile strength and springlike capacity, which renders them 'mechanically deaf,'\nas Cook says.\nThink of the islands of degenerated Achilles tendon tissue as holes in donuts. They are surrounded by healthy tissue. Research has shown that\nthe body will actually adapt and grow more normal tendon tissue around these dead spots in an effort to recover lost strength.  7"}, "883": {"text": "As mentioned previously, these 'holes' in the tendon do not create any pain.  8  Not until the surrounding healthy tissue becomes overloaded and slips into a reactive phase (in the same way that a perfectly healthy tendon would) does pain develop in a degenerated tendon. This is why someone could have a very degenerated tendon rupture without having any pain symptoms.  9"}, "884": {"text": "Some good ways to differentiate between 'reactive' and 'reactive on disrepair/degeneration' tendon pain (other than a history of symptoms) are the intensity of the pain, the exact mechanism that set off the injury, and how long recovery takes. For example, a true 'reactive' tendon is very painful and swollen. It is sparked by a severe overload (such as running a half marathon for the rst time or an extremely difficult training session lled with a ton of plyometric exercises). On the other hand, a 'reactive on disrepair/degeneration' tendon can be sparked by much less dramatic activity overload and often isn't accompanied by as much swelling. Pain from this form of tendinopathy can resolve in as little as a few days with proper rest, whereas pain in true 'reactive' tendons can take anywhere from four to eight weeks to dissipate.  10  Understanding which stage your symptoms indicate will dramatically affect how you attempt to manage the injury."}, "885": {"text": "Overload causes tendons to spark into reactive mode and become painful. Simple enough, right? Unfortunately, the Achilles tendon is a little more complicated. The Achilles tendon complex can become overloaded and injured in a few ways, all of which have slightly different symptoms and require different approaches to x.  11"}, "886": {"text": "A mid-tendon injury is caused by an overload in tensile load (a pulling force similar to stretching a rubber band). Your Achilles tendon acts like a spring when you run and perform multiple jumps. As you land, it stretches under load and quickly releases power to propel your body up and away. This rapid recoil force production is called the stretch shortening cycle (SSC) and is the foundation of plyometric training."}, "887": {"text": "If the adapted load tolerance set point is exceeded due to too much volume or intensity of training, the reactive phase can be sparked.

This area may be\nswollen and appear more pronounced upon examination. While a mid- tendon injury is believed to be largely due to an overload of tensile loads,\ninsertional tendinopathies are largely a combination of tensile loads and compression.\nThe amount of compression placed on the Achilles tendon against the calcaneus bone depends on the position of the ankle. Activities that load"}, "888": {"text": "the Achilles but keep the ankle in a plantarexed position, such as repetitive hopping on the toes, are not likely to bring out pain. On the\nother hand, activities that involve loading the ankle in dorsiexion\n(squatting, lunging, running up hills or on soft surfaces like a sandy beach, or even walking barefoot) will bring out pain as the shin is pulled into a\nmore angled position, compressing the Achilles against the heel bone.  12\nInterestingly enough, stretching the calf muscles in an attempt to relieve the symptoms of insertional tendinopathy will only cause more pain as the ankle is pulled into dorsiexion, creating more compression."}, "889": {"text": "This type of injury is not a true tendinopathy like the prior two. The injury is not to the tendon itself but to the thin sheath that surrounds it, called the peritendon . Pain is created by constant friction of the Achilles tendon against the peritendon during continuous low-load ankle movement rather than an overload of force.\nPERITENDON ANATOMY\nFor example, the peritendon can become injured during a long bike ride or after rowing a long distance. A major diagnostic sign is a cracking or popping sound/sensation called crepitus that occurs as the tendon fails to move smoothly within the thickened peritendon.  13  Left untreated, this injury can become debilitating."}, "890": {"text": "The rst priority during a physical examination for Achilles tendon pain is to make sure there hasn't been a complete rupture of the tendon. The calf squeeze test is an easy way to do so.  14\nTo perform the calf squeeze test (not pictured), lie on your stomach with your feet hanging freely over the edge of a bed or bench. Have a friend squeeze your calf muscle and see what happens to your foot. If the foot moves when the calf is squeezed, the Achilles tendon is intact, and you can move on to the next step, which is to diagnose the type of tendinopathy you are experiencing. If the foot does not move at all when the calf is squeezed, it would be a good idea to follow up with a medical professional for additional testing."}, "891": {"text": "The next step in the testing process is fairly simple.

All you need to do is review how the pain started and where you're experiencing symptoms and then evaluate how your Achilles tendon responds to loading."}, "892": {"text": "True Achilles tendinopathy symptoms manifest either at the insertion or in the mid-tendon and are provoked by load.  15  While both are related to overload, the mechanism of overload differs. Here's how to test your hypothesis. During each test, grade your pain on a scale of 0 to 10, 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst pain you can imagine.\nStart with a double-leg heel raise while standing on at ground, followed by a single-leg heel raise. If you do not feel pain, perform the same actions with your heels hanging off a plate or step. This time, allow your heels to sink below the ledge after performing the initial heel raise. If you had no pain on at ground but you do have pain with the heeldropped version, you probably have insertional Achilles tendinopathy.\nDOUBLE-LEG HEEL RAISE\nSINGLE-LEG HEEL RAISE WITH TOES ON PLATE"}, "893": {"text": "On the other hand, if you do have pain with the heel raise on at ground and your pain is located between 1 and 3 inches above the calcaneus, you are likely dealing with mid-tendon Achilles tendinopathy. Try performing multiple jumps or hops. If this repetitive higher-load motion creates more pain than a slow, controlled heel raise, you can bet it's mid-tendon Achilles tendinopathy. The location of the pain and when the pain occurs during testing can help differentiate between mid-tendon and insertional Achilles tendinopathy.\nSomeone with a peritendon injury will respond to these loading tests very differently. While a person with a mid-tendon injury will have more pain as the load is increased from a slow heel raise to a faster hop, a peritendon injury may present in the opposite manner: a slow heel raise could cause more pain as the ankle is controlled through a larger range of motion, contributing to more friction of the peritendon."}, "894": {"text": "The main takeaway here is that diagnosing a tendinopathy doesn't require a pricey MRI. In fact, looking at an MRI may lead your diagnosis astray because it is common to see abnormal signs of tendon degeneration in those without symptoms of pain!  16  A doctor may be able to detect tendon pathology by your imaging, but the image alone doesn't necessarily explain any symptoms you're having.\nPoking and prodding around the tendon to see if it hurts is not enough to diagnose tendinopathy, either. You must assess the functional capacity of the tendon with load testing. If it really is a tendinopathy injury, the results of the tests I've suggested will tell you so. Keep in mind that if your tendon is very reactive, you may have pain with all of the prior tests regardless of whether your injury is insertional or mid-tendon."}, "895": {"text": "Testing ankle mobility should be a part of the screening process when dealing with an injury to this area. When the gastroc and/or soleus muscles are stiff or short, there is less range of motion to absorb load during activities like landing from a jump, which places the Achilles tendon under greater strain.  17  Limited ankle mobility can be a risk factor for mid-tendon Achilles tendinopathy because the tendon has less range to absorb load; therefore, the tendon has to take more load more quickly. 18  With insertional Achilles tendinopathy, less dorsiexion may place less compression on the insertion.

You never want to rest a tendon completely!\nThe strength of your tendons follows the simple motto 'If you don't use it, you lose it.'  20  Taking away all loading and only resting for a few weeks sets you up for the pain to return. As mentioned earlier, the injury occurred because your training surpassed your current load tolerance level. If you take the next few weeks off, your body will adapt, and the tolerance level of your tendon will drop even further (because minimal load is being placed on it), making it easier to overload whenever you do return."}, "900": {"text": "On the ip side, if you continue to push through pain and load a painful tendon too much, the injury will only get worse; eventually, structural changes can take place in the tissues.

Make sure to recognize the depth to which you can squat without pain. Deep squatting may aggravate symptoms because the forward shin position can increase load on the tendon. You will gradually reintroduce these aggravating exercises into your training as your tendon heals and adapts to tolerate greater loads."}, "902": {"text": "If you are an elite athlete preparing for an important competition and you have no desire to step back from training to address your injuries, you must make a change to your training program (along with adding some of the exercises discussed later).

Try changing one variable in your training program and see how your tendon responds. For example, if you currently train seven days a week, decrease the frequency by dropping one session. If you can't sacrice one day of training, you must make a change to either the amount of high-intensity loads or the total volume of your training.

Heavy isometric exercises have been shown to alter this trajectory.\nResearch shows that isometrics have the potential to decrease tendon pain for upwards of 45 minutes afterward and can improve a person's strength thereafter by decreasing cortical inhibition. Isometrics allow you to express your strength by accessing more motor units that were previously 'turned off' due to pain.

While icing was originally intended to preserve severed limbs and decrease complications in the operating room, it eventually sneaked its way into being used for all injuries.\nIn 1978, Harvard physician Gabe Mirkin coined the term RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) for the recommended treatment for sports injuries in his landmark The Sports Medicine Book .  2  Since then, the medical community has used this protocol religiously for the treatment of acute injuries."}, "955": {"text": "Now, if you ask a medical doctor today why they recommend ice for a common ankle sprain or backache, they'll likely say that it alleviates pain, reduces inammation, and restricts swelling.

Mild movement helps tissue to heal faster, and the application of cold suppresses the immune responses that start and hasten recovery.

Macrophages are like Pac-Man chomping down all those tiny dots-in this case, the cells that died due to the initial trauma.

In fact, a lack of inammation blunts the healing process and contributes to poor muscle regeneration!  4  This 'blunting' of the healing process occurs when you use ice.\nPlacing ice on an injured area essentially puts a roadblock in front of the white blood cells trying to get to the area.

It's what we do about it that makes all the difference.\nYou see, following an injury, the blood vessels that surround the damaged tissue 'open up' to allow inammatory cells to arrive. This rush of cells out of the small blood vessels and into the damaged site also pulls additional uid into the surrounding tissue.

The reghters, police officers, and ambulance have arrived at the site to clear the debris, and they need a way to remove it from the roadway. Unfortunately, the uid that now contains waste can't leave the same way it came in (through the circulatory system); it has to be evacuated through an intricate network of vessels called the lymphatic system .\nYour body has a few different pathways to move uid from place to place.

(Think about this like a cow being milked.)\nCIRCULATORY SYSTEM VERSUS LYMPHATIC SYSTEM\nSwelling is merely the buildup of waste around an injured area that needs to be evacuated via the lymphatic system. It is a natural response to injury that becomes a problem only when the waste-lled uid is allowed to accumulate.

Icing did not improve how much a person could move their knee or lead to any decrease in swelling.\nSwelling is no doubt a signicant concern after any surgery, especially surgeries in the lower body, such as an ACL reconstruction. Swelling that builds in and around an injured area and remains can lead to a cascade of problems-decreased mobility, blunted strength, increased pain, and more.  10  But remember, icing does not help facilitate the pumping action of the 'passive' lymphatic system, which is the only way to remove swelling."}, "971": {"text": "Gary Reinl gave me a great analogy for this concept that I want to share with you. If you knew it was going to snow 2 inches every hour for the next 12 hours, what would you do? You'd likely open your front door and sweep off a small amount of snow every hour. If you procrastinate and wait until the snow has stopped falling, you'll open the door to nd 24 inches accumulated. Imagine how much more difficult it is to shovel 2 feet of snow all at once!\nShoveling a little bit every hour prevents the snow from accumulating, just like moving around frequently keeps lymph  fl uid from accumulating around an injured area. \u00a9 Amyinlondon | Dreamstime.com"}, "972": {"text": "Similarly, swelling accumulates around an injured area because you stop moving! It's not because there is 'excessive swelling' but rather because you aren't doing anything to facilitate lymphatic drainage to pull it away. Instead of using ice to try to block swelling from accumulating in the rst place (which clearly has detrimental effects), you need to be proactive and work on improving the evacuation of the uid and waste that does accumulate. No matter whether you sustained a minor injury like a sprained ankle or you just got out of surgery to repair a torn meniscus, you need to turn your attention to evacuating swelling, not preventing it.\nBut how do you facilitate this evacuation? You move."}, "973": {"text": "Remember when you would fall as a child and your mom or dad would yell, 'Walk it off!' It's quite possible that your parent was right all along about keeping it moving after getting injured. Too quickly we instruct athletes to shut it down completely after an ankle or knee injury. Keep in mind that moving too much and too aggressively may make things worse; I am merely proposing that you consider kicking off the healing process with light movement and active recovery methods.\nExercises performed in a relatively pain-free manner not only accelerate the removal of swelling through muscle contraction but also optimize the healing process without causing further damage. Moving the injured area may seem counterintuitive, but it's actually the best thing to do! Loading damaged tissue with proper exercises as soon as possible after injury accelerates the healing of muscle and bone.  11  The last thing you want to do is wait around to see how you feel tomorrow or the next day."}, "974": {"text": "Performing pain-free exercise following injury has countless benets. To start, muscle contraction enhances the inammation process by improving macrophage function (the cleanup crew) and allowing these essential white blood cells to remove damaged cells.  12  It also boosts muscle repair and regeneration and limits the formation of scar tissue through activation of stem cells (called satellite cells ).  13\nAfter injury, the goal of movement is to facilitate healing without causing additional damage. Exercise too intensely and place too much load on your body, and you're only going to make the injury worse. This is why it's not a good idea to perform heavy back squats one day after spraining your ankle or attempt to run four weeks after ACL reconstruction surgery."}, "975": {"text": "Loading the body in a pain-free manner allows you to nd the crossroads between efficient and safe recovery. One of the safest muscle contractions for acute injuries and post-op cases is isometrics. Isometric describes the action of muscle contraction without joint movement. Try this: First straighten your knee. Then squeeze your quad muscle as hard as you can for 10 seconds. You just completed an isometric contraction for this muscle group! In the early rehabilitation stage following ACL reconstruction surgery (one to four weeks post-op), I often prescribe isometric quad sets to my patients to restore quad strength, decrease pain, and-guess what?-evacuate swelling."}, "976": {"text": "The smallest amount of muscle contraction can help remove swelling through the passive lymphatic system, prevent disuse atrophy by increasing muscle protein synthesis (helping you preserve muscle mass while you recover), and reduce pain. This is why simple exercises like ankle pumps (repeatedly moving your toes toward and away from your head) can be so helpful for athletes directly after sustaining an ankle sprain.\nAs the pain decreases, the load should be increased to facilitate optimal healing. For someone with knee pain, for example, this may mean progressing bodyweight squats from partial depth to full depth and eventually adding a weighted barbell."}, "977": {"text": "People always ask, 'What about those who cannot physically contract their muscles because of signicant weakness or for whom weightbearing exercises are limited due to post-op surgical precautions?'\nWhile voluntary exercise is undoubtedly the most effective way to preserve muscle mass, reduce swelling, and kick-start the healing process after injury, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) devices come in a close second. NMES devices work by stimulating muscle contraction through electricity. Place the electrode pads on your quad, turn up the intensity, and suddenly your muscles begin to contract all by themselves!"}, "978": {"text": "NMES devices have multiple uses that can be helpful for an athlete recovering from injury. One of the best-known uses is to reduce swelling. 14  By stimulating involuntary muscle contraction, NMES devices help pump excess uid/waste out of the injured area through the passive lymphatic system and dilate blood vessels to bring in nutrients and white blood cells to enhance the healing process. Because swelling buildup can create pain and lead to muscle atrophy (as most people don't want to move a painful area of the body), NMES can decrease symptoms and prevent loss of muscle mass in the early stages of recovery.  15  In fact, research has shown that a single NMES session can increase muscle protein synthesis by 27 percent.  16\nA neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) device."}, "979": {"text": "The other great feature of NMES devices is their ability to eliminate pain through sensory modication. This allows an athlete recovering from severe injury or surgery to manage pain safely without having to rely on narcotics. Simply put, after injury, we want to promote movement (even if it's as little as stimulated muscle contractions through the use of an E-stim device) to optimize healing and safely return to the sports we love."}, "980": {"text": "So I've touched on how ice can hinder the natural healing process after minor and major injuries, but what about using ice after an intense workout?\nElite athletes around the world are always searching for the best techniques to accelerate recovery and gain an edge on the competition. In this quest, many swear by jumping in an ice bath or strapping some ice packs across their legs after heavy training. I've known many weightlifters who claim that ice baths are the only recovery technique that allows them to get through a high-volume squat cycle. But what does the science say?\nDuring a hard workout, your muscles sustain tiny amounts of damage. This 'trauma' sparks inammation, similar to what happens after an acute injury, like a sprained ankle. The rush of inammatory cells to the site of 'damage' helps kick-start recovery by eliminating damaged cells and then recruiting stem cells from the surrounding tissues to assist in repairing and regenerating new muscle cells."}, "981": {"text": "If you comb through the available science on the use of ice after intense workouts, the main nding is that ice baths decrease the perception of muscle soreness by changing how the body senses pain.  17 As far as the effect of ice baths on recovery of performance in the next training session, the research is split. Some studies show that a 5- to 10minute plunge can boost performance during the next training session, while others say it has no effect. A few even say that it can be detrimental. 18\nHere's my opinion: Periodic use of ice baths may assist some athletes who need to recover quickly between same-day training sessions and competitions. In general, however, you should avoid the regular use of ice baths because the continued use of ice can be harmful to the natural adaptation process for developing muscle strength and hypertrophy. Let me explain why.\nThe research on the bene fi ts of using ice baths after training is not conclusive.\n\u00a9 Olaf\nSchuelke / Alamy Stock Photo Image ID: KGKH1E"}, "982": {"text": "Muscle soreness and muscle fatigue are not the same thing. While you may\nfeel less soreness after icing, you're not necessarily recovering any\nfaster physiologically. Remember, there is a reason for soreness. It is a normal reaction to intense training, just like the inammation cycle is a\nnormal response to injury. However, the more accustomed an athlete is to a particular style and intensity of training, the quicker they recover\nbetween sessions, and the less soreness they feel.\nThis is why, the day after a high-volume squat session, you feel so sore you can barely stand up from a chair. However, two weeks into the same\ntraining cycle, you don't feel nearly as sore following similar workouts.\nYour body adapts to the training stimulus; this is known as the repeated\nbout effect . This is why a majority of the research on elite athletes has shown ice baths not to help with recovery and performance.  19"}, "983": {"text": "In fact, multiple research studies have shown that icing interferes with the normal adaptive response to exercise that helps us recover and gain strength. Here is a direct quote from one such article: 'These data suggest that topical cooling, a commonly used clinical intervention, seems to not improve but rather delay recovery from eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.'  20\nUnless you're looking for an instantaneous bounce-back on the day of a competition, you should be very cautious of the long-term effects of ice on recovery. When you take time to look at the science, you can see that using ice after a workout has the long-term potential to stunt muscle growth and strength gains.  21"}, "984": {"text": "Instead of reaching for that ice pack or jumping into a tub lled with ice, I recommend using an active recovery approach. Go for a 10-minute walk, perform a light workout of bodyweight squats, or even go for a swim or bike ride-basically, get off the couch and do any nonfatiguing exercise that gets your body moving and your blood pumping.\nIf you're extremely sore the day after an intense workout, I recommended performing a few minutes of soft tissue mobilization. Research has shown that a few minutes of rolling on a foam roller or small ball (such as a lacrosse or tennis ball) can signicantly reduce delayedonset muscle soreness (DOMS).  22"}, "985": {"text": "If you don't have time to get in a light workout or you're feeling a little under the weather, try using an NMES device like the Marc Pro, Powerdot, or Complex. These devices mimic the muscle pump of active movement. The use of such a device delivers nonfatiguing muscle contraction without effort that will enhance lymphatic drainage to remove cellular waste that accumulates after heavy training and increase blood ow to stimulate the recovery and repair process.  23"}, "986": {"text": "If you still aren't convinced that the benets of icing have been overblown and that icing is at-out wrong in many cases, I offer you one last piece of evidence.\nEvery year, a group of experts in the treatment of acute injuries gather to comb over the current scientic literature and establish position statements for the National Athletic Trainers' Association (NATA). In 2013, the group released a statement on the recommended treatment for ankle sprains, an injury commonly addressed with the RICE protocol.  24\nAfter evaluating all of the available scientic literature on possible treatments for ankle sprains, the experts assigned ratings from best ('A') to worst ('C'). Do you know which rating icing got? A big fat 'C.' The NATA team even wrote that 'strong clinical evidence for advocating cryotherapy is limited.'"}, "987": {"text": "Do you know which treatment was assigned an 'A' rating? Functional rehabilitation! With this position statement, the profession that sees a majority of acute injuries among athletes acknowledges that icing is not as good as we all once thought; rather, the best form of treatment is moving and loading the injured area through rehabilitation exercises.\nAt the end of the day, our approach to treating injuries and soreness after training is quite simple. We want to get the good stuff (white blood cells) in and the bad stuff (swelling that includes cellular debris from the damaged tissue) out. I hope you can see that this process is not optimized by using ice."}, "988": {"text": "1. F. M. Massie, 'Refrigeration anesthesia for amputation,' Annals of Surgery 123, no. 5 (1946): 937-47.\n2. G.
