       " 'Introduction Behind many a legendary tale, there is a hidden lesson to be learned. Those who incorporate weight training with the goal of improving their physique, strength, or power should look to the story of Milo of Croton. Milo was an ancient Greek Olympian and the poster child for athletic excellence in his time. Legend has it that at a young age, Milo started his strength journey by lifting a small calf and carrying it on his shoulders',\n",
       " 'every day. As the calf grew over the years, so did Milo\\'s strength, until one day he was hoisting a full-grown bull! Although it is unlikely that he was able to lift a 1,500-pound bull, like any good story, the legend sprang from humble beginnings. The 2,500-year-old story of how Milo built his heroic strength set forth the training principle that all athletes adhere to. That principle is now known as \"progressive overload.\" Within Milo\\'s story is the idea that hard',\n",
       " 'work combined with consistency can lead to legendary feats of strength and awe-inspiring athletic performance. Deep inside each and every one of us is an innate desire to become our own version of Milo. The idea of building incredible strength and meeting our physical goals is why so many of us push our bodies day in',\n",
       " 'and day out. While at surface level the story of Milo may seem simple, the reality is that the process of building extraordinary strength is as much about grit, hard work, and determination as it is about science. You see, our bodies adhere to a scientific \"code,\" a simple framework of rules governed by the laws of biology and physiology. The code is simple. To develop strength, you must strike a balance between stress and recovery. Every time you perform a set of squats, pick up a heavy',\n",
       " 'deadlift, or press a barbell overhead, you place a stress on your body. The harder your training session, the more stress you accumulate. To progressively develop more and more strength, the demands of your training must not exceed the adaptive capabilities of your body. Therefore, training must be balanced with recovery for the body to adapt, rebuild itself, and gain strength. If you follow this code, the sky is the limit for athletic performance. Sounds simple enough, right? Not so fast.',\n",
       " 'Sounds simple enough, right? Not so fast. In our pursuit of amassing strength, we all push the envelope. Our inner competitor drives us to complete one more rep, put 10 more pounds on the bar, and take one more attempt at setting a personal record on a lift. This kind of determination is vital if you want to excel as a strength athlete. However, it can just as quickly become a double-edged sword. When we push our bodies to their physical limits and ignore the code,',\n",
       " \"they eventually push back. I have never met a strength athlete who didn't have a nagging injury at some point in their career. Sometimes these injuries interfere with their training. When we push our bodies to the max and don't focus on sufficient recovery and or lack ideal technique, injuries will occur. As fate would have it, in our quest to become our own version of Milo, we wind up falling short of our destination. I want to share two stories with you.\",\n",
       " 'Josiah O\\'Brien was like many powerlifters. He was a hard worker who was loyal to his friends and family, and he loved lifting heavy weight in the gym with death metal blasting. He never used a foam roller and thought mobility work was a waste of time. When parts of his body started to hurt, he ignored the pain. He lived by the mantra \"no pain, no gain.\" Unfortunately, this lifestyle eventually caught up with him. On October 22, 2016, Josiah entered a competition at 22nd Street',\n",
       " 'Barbell in Des Moines, Iowa. The meet started like any other. After successfully completing his second of 3 squat attempts at 638 pounds, he decided to go for 655, a feat only 5 pounds heavier than his personal best at the time. After unracking the massive weight, he took a few steps back and set his feet. To his surprise, the bar felt \"light\" on his back. However, as he descended into the squat, disaster struck. He heard and felt both legs',\n",
       " \"snap. The weight came crashing down, pinning his legs behind his body as he crumpled to the floor. That day, Josiah ended up tearing almost every supporting ligament and tendon (quad and patellar) in both knees. He was rushed to the nearest hospital in the bed of his friend's truck, unable to sit in the back seat, as the massive amount of swelling and pain wouldn't allow him to bend his knees. This was only the start of his troubles. Josiah ended up\",\n",
       " 'developing rhabdomyolysis, a serious condition in which the kidneys start to fail because the muscle damage to the body is so severe.

You place more force on your spine when deadlifting 600 pounds than you do when deadlifting 100 pounds.',\n",

There is no \"X number of movements\" that one can safely perform under a certain load before a disc herniation develops. But the mechanism for injury remains the same.',\n",
       " \"With this understanding in mind, let's dive a little deeper into some of the common forms of back injury sustained by strength athletes. Disc Bulges and Herniation What exactly is a disc bulge? Many healthcare professionals explain this injury using a jelly donut as an analogy.\",\n",
       " 'The nucleus pulposus (the gel-like center of a spinal disc) is kind of like the jelly inside a jelly donut. Between each pair of vertebral bones lies a disc. Like a jelly donut, each disc of the spine has an inner gel-like center called the nucleus pulposus. If there is too much compression on the spine, the vertebrae will be squeezed together, and, like the jelly in a donut being smashed, the gel will be forced out of the disc that lies between those vertebrae.',\n",
       " 'However, this isn\\'t as good of an analogy as many think. Here\\'s why. Barbell training places a considerable amount of compression on the spine, but most of that compression actually comes from the back muscles. As you pull a barbell from the ground, for example, the muscles that surround your spine tighten down to create enough stiffness to keep your spinal \"tower\" from buckling. The contraction of these muscles (along with the force of the weight being lifted) compresses the spinal column.',\n",
       " 'The nucleus pulposus is surrounded by many ringlike layers of a strong material called collagen. While you can easily push the jelly out of the center of a donut by smashing it with your hands, the collagen rings that surround the nuclei of your spinal discs are extremely tough. As the nucleus of the disc becomes pressurized by load, the tough collagen rings contain its jellylike material. This is why a disc bulge is rare when the spine',\n",
       " 'is compressed in a neutral position; the power generated at the spine remains relatively low when force is high but velocity is low. 15',\n",
       " 'However, if the spine is loaded and then moved, the story changes. When power increases at the spine (through a combination of load with movement in and out of flexion), the collagen layers of the disc slowly begin to crack and break apart; this process is called delamination. 16',\n",
       " 'When the collagen rings of a disc break apart or \"delaminate,\" the disc loses its ability to withstand load. If the combination of load and movement at the spine continues, the pressurized inner gel of the disc',\n",

In the weight room, a combination of load and movement occurs when an athlete allows their back to move when deadlifting or allows their lumbar spine to round at the bottom of a squat (known as \"butt',\n",

I often hear discussions across the internet where people claim, \"Butt winking is not dangerous!\" If the spine were composed of ball-and- socket joints like the hip and shoulder, I would agree.

Most medical books that discuss stretching would have you believe that increases in flexibility are often due to the mechanical model, and the muscle itself is actually lengthening when stretched. There are three theories under this model that try to justify the changes in flexibility: Viscoelastic deformation: This is a fancy way of saying that muscles have both an elastic component (like a rubber band) and a viscous or gooey component (similar to honey). The idea is that as',\n",
       " 'a stretch is applied, the force causes the muscle to relax, and flexibility improves. However, research has been quick to disprove this theory, as any changes seen because of viscoelastic deformation are likely short-lived. For example, one research study showed that a hamstring stretch held for 45 seconds had no significant effect on the next stretch performed 30 seconds later.',\n",
       " '106 If the muscle really deformed and stayed that way, the researchers would have seen a significant difference. Plastic deformation: Another popular theory states that the increased flexibility observed after a stretch exists because the connective tissues that make up the muscle are stretched to a point where they become permanently lengthened. Research to support this notion, however, has been poor. 107 Increased sarcomeres in series: The third theory is based on the',\n",
       " 'idea that the building blocks that make up muscle (called sarcomeres) increase in number in response to a stretch. Think of a sarcomere like a LEGO brick. A muscle is made up of thousands of muscle fibers, each of which is composed of a long block chain of sarcomeres. Based on a few animal studies, researchers found that if they created a long held stretch (by splinting or immobilizing a joint in a cast for a few weeks and holding the muscle in a',\n",
       " 'lengthened position), the body would increase the number of sarcomeres (more LEGO bricks in a row) by upwards of 20 percent. 108 Basically, the block chain inside each muscle fiber is stretched to such a degree that the body decides to add more blocks to the chain to restore the prior \"normal\" balance. However, what most people don\\'t understand about this adaptive change is that it appears without an overall change in muscle length! While there',\n",
       " 'may be more blocks in the chain of sarcomeres, the length of each block becomes smaller. The blocks basically shrink! Also, these adaptive changes do not last long; the muscle returns to its prior \"normal\" number of sarcomeres within a few weeks. 109 So, while these few animal studies have shown there to be changes in the muscle architecture after four weeks of an immobilization stretch, it is a bit far-fetched to think that these same changes would be',\n",
       " \"seen after an intermittent stretching program like the ones used by most athletes. The second and more probable theory for how stretching improves flexibility is a change in sensation. The latest research has shown that much of the short-term increase in flexibility comes from improving your stretch tolerance (or pain tolerance), not from increasing your muscles' length! 110 Basically, after stretching your hamstrings for a few sets of 30\",\n",
       " 'seconds, you have more flexibility because of your ability to tolerate a greater amount of stretch before you tap out. What Are the Effects of a Long-Term Stretching Program? Unfortunately, almost all of the studies published on the effects of stretching have lasted only between three and eight weeks. The improvements seen in these short-term programs are a result of increased tolerance to muscle stretching. The research shows that there is no actual lengthening of the muscle fibers. 111',\n",

It is entirely possible that individuals who partake in a rigorous stretching program for years actually can alter the extensibility of their muscles.

The Back Pain-Tight Hamstring Connection Let's switch gears and talk about why so many athletes are quick to stretch their hamstrings, especially those who have back pain. Here is a normal thought process that goes through the minds of many in the medical community when assessing someone who is experiencing back pain:\",\n",
       " 'When assessing the patient\\'s straight-leg raise, they were unable to raise either leg past 70 degrees. We were taught in school that this means the person has \"tight\" or short hamstrings. Short hamstrings have been shown in research to be associated with low back pain. This means we need to stretch the hamstrings as a part of the rehabilitation plan to decrease the back pain. Sound familiar? In 2000, a group of researchers from the Netherlands conducted a',\n",
       " 'study in which they looked at a number of factors among three groups: those with flexible hamstrings, those with \"tight\" hamstrings, and those with low back pain. 112 Here\\'s what they found: Those with low back pain had the lowest hip range of motion via the SLR test (even worse than those with just \"tight\" hamstrings). The researchers concluded that this decreased range of motion was due only to the hamstrings and did not have to do with any pelvic tilting or back mobility issues.',\n",
       " '1. The hamstrings in both the flexible group and the \"tight\" group showed a similar \"defense reaction\" as they were stretched. The farther the legs were stretched, the more electrical activity rose in all of the hamstring muscles. However, those with low back pain had an abnormal \"defense reaction\" and did not have simultaneous electrical activity in all of their hamstrings. Also, the electrical activity they did record did not increase at the same',\n",
       " 'gradual pace as it did in those who were pain-free. This difference was attributed to a heightened arousal or sensitivity to movement that occurs in those with back pain. There was no difference in muscle stiffness between those with \"tight\" hamstrings and those in the low back pain group. Hamstring flexibility in those with low back pain was worse than in those with \"tight\" hamstrings, but this limited motion was not accompanied by an increase in muscular stiffness.',\n",
       " \"accompanied by an increase in muscular stiffness. Here's what this means: low back pain coupled with limited hamstring flexibility is usually due to the nervous system going haywire. The hamstring muscles are reacting and behaving differently, which can affect a person's ability to tolerate a stretch. The Treatment Plan Armed with the information that limited hamstring flexibility is due to a neuromuscular issue in individuals dealing with back pain, the solution is\",\n",
       " 'not passive stretching. So what should you do instead? The three-step process for fixing back pain is as follows: Wind down pain sensitivity by avoiding the motions, postures, and loads that trigger your pain. This will be different for each person and requires efficient screening.',\n",
       " '2. 3. Improve core stability and mobility of the joint complexes above and below the site of pain. Improve movement quality: learn to move about the hips instead of the low back and reactivate the glutes. 113 Viewing the Hamstrings in a New Light Since we know that the hamstrings are not a cause of low back pain, we need to change our approach to how and when to improve hamstring flexibility. We must first discuss the difference between flexibility and',\n",
       " \"mobility. We can test the flexibility or length of the hamstrings by performing the SLR test discussed on here and here. Mobility is different; it has a movement component and describes the body's ability to use its flexibility, muscle tension quality, and nervous system (aka motor control) to coordinate itself through a range. Mobility should always be evaluated before flexibility. Let's take the example of Jim, a national-level Olympic weightlifter. Jim has great hip\",\n",
       " 'mobility and coordination of his core stability and posterior chain muscles. He shows great-looking technique during his barbell lifts of the clean and snatch. If you ask him to bend over and touch his toes, he will perform what looks like a barbell RDL without any weight in his hands because his body has been programmed to move correctly about the hips over and over again in the gym. However, if you took Jim without looking at the quality of his',\n",
       " 'movement and had him perform the SLR test, you might find that he has relatively \"tight\" hamstrings, as he is unable to lift his free leg straight past 80 degrees. Does this mean he should automatically be prescribed hamstring stretches? What if I told you that the relatively \"stiff\" hamstrings of some athletes are an advantage and not a problem that needs to be stretched away?',\n",
       " 'Think of your muscles as springs. When they are loaded with tension, they have the ability to explode with power and propel your body down a track. Now, 20-plus years ago, long-duration stretching was all the rage because researchers believed that static stretches before a workout or an athletic completion could help reduce the risk of a muscular strain injury. 114 So, if Jim had gone to a physical therapist back then, he would have',\n",
       " \"been prescribed some long-duration (1 minute-plus) static stretching for his hamstrings by lying on his back and pulling his foot to the sky. Nowadays the tides are turning. A growing amount of new research is showing that this type of stretching before exercise can lead to decreases in strength, power, and speed, thereby limiting an athlete's performance. 115 This is part of the reason why both the American College of Sports Medicine and the European College of Sports Sciences have come out\",\n",
       " 'condemning long-duration static stretching as part of a warm-up routine! 116 Now, does this mean we should never stretch? Not at all. Some athletes would benefit from a certain amount of stretching to improve their flexibility, get into better technical positions, and move more efficiently during training and competition. If you want to stretch before a training session or competition, I recommend short-duration stretches (less than 30 seconds), which have been shown to have no harmful effects',\n",
       " \"on muscular performance. 117 It's not until the stretch is held for more than 45 seconds that we see losses in strength, power, and speed. In fact, research has shown that the ability of a muscle to produce force when subjected to these long-duration stretches (which are still prescribed by many fitness trainers and coaches) is decreased for up to 30 minutes. 118 Will there be athletes who need long-duration stretches? Sure. I wouldn't discontinue them completely, but their use must be\",\n",

Final Thoughts on Hamstring Stretching Every aspect of a training or rehab program has a purpose. At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself why you are implementing each exercise, including stretches. For years, we have been taught that if a muscle is tight, we need to stretch it to return it to what a textbook would tell us is \"normal.\"',\n",
       " '\"normal.\" I hope you now understand that those who are in pain do not have \"normal\" hamstring flexibility. Their bodies are reacting differently due to pain injury, which creates a facade of \"muscle tightness.\" 120 For this reason, someone with back pain can\\'t just stretch away the limited hamstring flexibility. Also, just because someone has \"tight\" hamstrings does not mean they will develop back pain. 121 In fact, some athletes have short or stiff',\n",
       " 'hamstrings for a reason. Remember, muscle length testing was developed years ago based on the idea that there is a \"normal\" or ideal range of muscle length for optimal movement and safety.

       " 'CHAPTER 2 HIP PAIN An injury to the hip is one of the most common problems for a strength athlete. Despite how prevalent this injury is, it can be one of the most complicated to diagnose and treat because pain can develop in any of several muscles that surround and attach to the femur or pelvis -hip flexor strains, groin pulls, piriformis syndrome, and so on.',\n",
       " 'To make matters even more difficult, hip pain can arise from the hip joint itself or even radiate down from an injury in the back! For this reason, performing a proper screening is imperative to uncovering why your symptoms are present, which will lead you to the right steps for fixing your pain. Hip Anatomy To understand how injury occurs at the hip, we need to start by discussing basic hip anatomy. The hip is a ball-and-socket joint. The end of the thigh',\n",
       " 'bone (femur) is shaped like a small ball. It fits within the \"socket\" (acetabulum) of the hip and connects at a slight angle, allowing the foot to be positioned relatively straight forward when standing, walking, and squatting.',\n",
       " 'However, not everyone fits this textbook bone structure. Variations in the ways our hips are shaped can impact how we move, especially the way we squat, deadlift, or catch a snatch in a deep receiving position. These anatomical differences must be assessed and uncovered during a proper evaluation, as they can play a large role in the development of hip pain. So how prevalent are these variations? Well, in 2001, a group of researchers in Japan took a close look at the hip joint. While a majority of',\n",
       " 'the subjects had \"normal\" hip sockets, close to 40 percent did not! 1 Some people have hip sockets that open to the side, while others point more forward. A small change in how the hip socket opens can have a dramatic effect on how the body moves. For example, as you squat, your femur rotates in the socket and your thigh moves toward your torso (the movement of hip flexion). If someone',\n",
       " 'has a hip socket that opens laterally (called acetabular retroversion), their femur will come into contact with the front edge of the acetabulum sooner during a deep squat than if the socket opened more toward the front of the body. A simple test can give you a better understanding of the alignment and shape of your hip sockets. Start by lying on your back. Bring your knee toward your chest in a straight line. See how far your thigh moves before',\n",
       " 'you feel a \"blocked\" sensation. Next, perform the same movement but allow your thigh to move out to the side and your foot to rotate inward slightly (an abducted and externally rotated position of the hip). What did you find? Research has shown that those with retroverted hip sockets are often able to bring their knee closer to their chest with the knee angled out to the side. 2',\n",
       " 'This movement of bringing your knee to your chest also gives you insight into the depth of your hip socket. If you cannot bring your knee very close to your chest in either position (straight or angled away from your body) without feeling a blocked sensation in your hip, you may have a deep hip socket. Conversely, if you can bring your knee all the way to your chest without any pinching sensation (and without your lower back coming up off the ground), you likely have a shallower hip socket.',\n",
       " 'Think of the connection between your femur and hip socket like a small ball sitting on some dinnerware. If the ball (end of your femur) was sitting in a bowl, it could move around only so much before hitting the edge. But what would happen if you placed the ball on a plate?

The glute medius is a large fan-shaped muscle that runs from the lateral part of your pelvis (iliac crest) and connects with a single tendon to your femur. 25 The glute minimus is a smaller muscle that fits right behind the glute medius and also attaches to the femur.

       " 'For example, while many people think the glute medius is one big muscle, research shows that it is composed of three distinct parts with unique actions. 27 The posterior muscle fibers act with the entire glute minimus muscle to pull the femur into the hip socket (acetabulum) to help stabilize the hip joint, basically keeping the ball in the middle of the socket. The middle and anterior portions work together to initiate lateral',\n",

Along with beginning any lateral leg movement, the anterior fibers of the glute medius can create or limit pelvis rotation. However, when you're on your feet, these muscles take on a slightly different role. When you run, lunge, or squat, the glute medius and minimus act together to steady the hip joint (limiting knee cave) and keep the pelvis from tipping, rotating, or shifting from side to side. This allows\",\n",

Both muscle groups act as stabilizers for their respective joints. Contrary to what you may have learned in anatomy class, your lateral glute muscles are more of a movement stabilizer than a prime mover of the lower body. This understanding helps guide us in creating more efficient training and better corrective exercises for the hip joint.',\n",
       " 'As I explained earlier, most people with lateral hip pain have a gluteal tendinopathy injury. If you skip ahead to the Knee Pain chapter, specifically the section on patellar and quad tendinopathy (see here to here), I explain there that tendon injuries occur due to relative overuse or overload of these tissues. They can occur in an untrained individual who starts a high-intensity program or even in an elite athlete who deconditions their body while on vacation and then jumps right back into',\n",

If the body is not allowed to recover after a rapid increase in the intensity and or frequency of training, the tendon becomes \"reactive,\" and the injury process begins. Gluteal tendinopathy occurs due to two main types of overloading: excessive stretching of the tendon fibers (much like stretching a rubber band) and or too much compressive force (from the tendon being smashed into the tissues bone underneath). These forces, called tensile',\n",

For about 12 percent of the population, the nerve runs through the actual piriformis muscle. 32 This nerve runs from the low back (lumbar spine) down your thigh and extends to your feet. When irritated, it can cause pain deep in your glutes as well as symptoms like numbness and tingling that shoots down the back of your leg.',\n",
       " 'Historically, piriformis syndrome was thought to be caused by a muscle spasm or an excessively tight piriformis muscle. When shortened or in spasm, the piriformis can compress the sciatic nerve, creating pain that radiates down the leg. However, some experts now believe that this injury can also be caused when the piriformis is excessively stretched or elongated. 33 With a lengthened piriformis, repetitive movements of the hip (such as',\n",
       " 'knee collapse when squatting or lifting with an excessive anterior pelvic',\n",
       " 'tilt) can strain the muscle and cause friction on the nearby sciatic nerve, resulting in inflammation and pain. 34 Therefore, we actually have two possible causes of piriformis syndrome-long or short piriformis-that require two drastically different treatments to fix! The difficult part is distinguishing between the two, as they share some similar symptoms: Short piriformis syndrome is associated with pain when sitting for prolonged periods and limited hip internal rotation. This injury',\n",

Hamstring Tendinopathy Another common injury that can create pain deep in the glutes is a proximal hamstring tendinopathy.

Turning the toes out',\n",

There will always be a few individuals who are simply unable to get into a deep squat due to abnormal anatomy. With that said, most athletes should be able to achieve a full-depth bodyweight squat.

If you perform a squat or catch a snatch in a deep receiving position and maintain your knees in alignment with your feet, the load is evenly distributed across the patellofemoral joint. If the knee does not track in this ideal manner and begins to wobble from side to side, however, problems can eventually arise.',\n",

The most common reason strength athletes develop pain around the kneecap is a lack of ability to control for rotation at the knee (i.e., demonstrating poor knee stability when lifting). If your knee wobbles as you squat, catch a clean, or stand up in a deadlift, the patella shifts and tilts off-axis in the patellar groove. 5 This wobbling not only creates uneven pressure on the underside of the bone but also places excessive',\n",

The exact reason for the development of this pain is debated; some people blame it on excessive friction, while others believe it is a compression issue. Let me explain. The initial thinking was that when the IT band is excessively tight, it shifts forward and backward repetitively over the lateral femoral condyle',\n",

However, recent research has shown that the IT band is, in fact, firmly attached to the distal femur by strong fibrous strands, preventing it from rolling over the condyle as previously thought. In fact, the rolling movement that many see when the knee is flexed and straightened is not a true movement but instead is a shifting in the tension of the IT band. As',\n",

Medically, this is classified as a form of enthesopathy.',\n",

Every time you place stress on your body (such as when working out), tissue is broken down and then regenerated. Over time, this natural replenishing process is how strength is built. In your tendons, this process is largely controlled by small cells called tenocytes that are dispersed among aligned fibers called collagen-type 1',\n",
