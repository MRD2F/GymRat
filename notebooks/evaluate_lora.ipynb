The exercise involves squatting down onto one leg and then extending the opposite leg back to a high plank position. The goal is to maintain a high plank position and squat down onto the single leg, while alternating between squatting and extending the opposite leg. The exercise can be performed with or without weights, and it is a great way to improve balance, strength, and flexibility."

If you experience pain in this position, it could be a sign that your lower back is not well-supported or that you may be overweight or overextending your lower back. This could also indicate that you have a sedentary lifestyle or a lack of exercise. To modify this position to alleviate pain, try using a strap or block to support your legs and feet while standing.
